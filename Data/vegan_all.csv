So here's what I'm thinking about:

I don't want to start a business. I don't have time and energy to invest in making it work and I'm also fiercely opposed to the profit motive what with being a raging leftist commie! ü§£

I'm also not interested in running into debt. I'm married with kids and that's a quick road to a divorce! 

So threading that line I was thinking what if I ran a donation based thing?

I want to give people what I make and just cover the costs.

Is there a model out there for this type of activity?

I'm thinking I could put it out there that I'll be in such a location with a car full of vegan food and hand it out to the community. Hopefully vegans would show up but probably more important to nonvegans.

Or would it make more sense to link in with vegan activists. Show up and feed people doing the hard work?

I obviously am still working out the details so just looking for any advice or ideas people have.

*Additonal information for those interested:*  
*Palm   oil is in  over 50% of products found throughout the UK and is heavily   processed in  the western diet, this could reasonably be seen as a  huge  health risk.*  
*This   research  is a small part of my PhD but a very important one, I am   looking at the  awareness of palm oil and palmitic acid throughout the  UK  with a focus  on the differences based on age, ethnicity, body   composition, physical  activity and lifestyle. This will really help  when  I progress to the  next phase(s) of my research. Other aspects of  my  research include a  systematic review with meta-analysis, a fatty  acid  analysis, as well as  blood/stool samples from participants with   differing levels of palm  oil consumption.*  
*We   all know  palm oil is particular bad for the environment (and this  will  be  outlined heavily in my research), however, the main goal(s) of  the   research is to determine 1) if palm oil is healthy/unhealthy, as  the   literature does not provide a concrete answer at this time - or  provides   contradictory statements/findings 2) at what level of  consumption, for   how long a period of time can humans consume palm  oil/palmitic acid   before it becomes a minor, or major health risk, 3)  is it more prevalent   in a vegan diet when compared with omnivore,  vegetarian pescatarian,   flexitarian etc 4) how does it affect brain  function, gut microbiome   diversity, metabolic syndrome/metabolic  health 5) is it beneficial for   some people, for example those with  ADHD (very little science on the   subject currently).*

I thought I might as well live in the woods and never pay for clothing or electricity or any pleasures again if I was going to go *such lengths.*

Then I was confronted with my hypocrisy, and after a lifetime of eating habits rooted in cognitive dissonance and buried distress I just- stopped doing it.

Yes, there are some challenges. I already think they're trumped by other challenges in my life, like navigating new responsibilities with my age, getting a job, and driving.

Basically I'm primarily vegan but working to iron out a few details that prevent complete overnight transition. **I understand this isn't ideal and I welcome criticism and advice.**

I have always loved cooking content of all kinds. Watching people cook and prep food is so relaxing and informative to me. But I've noticed a growing problem. I literally can't watch when meat is the focus. Even in commercials turn away when meat is being cut. And on my favorite channels (primarily Japanese and Korean lifestyle channels with minimal talking) I have to skip some or all of the videos just to level out my emotional reaction. 

I know there are many vegan cooking channels. But only a few have hit me in the same way generic cooking content has. 

Part of me sees this as great but I kinda feel sad about it too. I'm not going to stop going vegan. I think I'm finally seeing the dystopian nightmare that animal agriculture is and coping with it is hard and I have a lot of respect for vegans and especially longtime vegans.

**TL;DR: I love cooking content but it's increasingly harder to watch and learn from when all I think about is the animal their killing. I don't know if I need advice or to let this keep progressing. Is this normal?**

However, I've recently been considering a potential exception and I wanted your thoughts on it, to see whether I'm insane for thinking this, or if I have somewhat of a point. So please be kind, and give genuine answers, as I am an ally who is simply trying to get other perspectives. 

So essentially, the exception arises when it comes to new experiences as a human being. For example, I am going to Canada in a couple weeks. During my time in Canada, I plan on visiting the museums, science centers, etc of Canada and really getting invested into their culture and how they live. Seeing as how food plays a pivotal role in an area's culture, I was debating on maybe trying genuine Canadian bacon. As an American, I have never consumed genuine Canadian bacon (speaking from before I went vegan). Now, I will also like to state that I plan on eating vegan food as well, as I would also like to experience and try another country's take on vegan food too. 

However, at a fundamental level, is it as bad to try a food or a dish that you had never tried before if it would be a ""once in a lifetime experience?"" Even knowing that it isn't vegan? As It's not like I'm going to go to Canada ever week. Just wondering what everyone's thoughts are and if this exception makes sense or has some merit. Of course, I am aware of the animal's pain and suffering that would go into consuming this dish. However, speaking as a human being who is only going to be alive for 80ish years, I wonder if a once in a lifetime experience justifies this act.",vegan,Curious about your thoughts on potential exceptions to being vegan,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/xt4byi/curious_about_your_thoughts_on_potential/,True

I have been vegan since 2020. I did get sick around then, but likely had this illness for years. 

Whenever I tell coworkers about my illness or it often comes up because sometimes I go to the bathroom like 1000 times a day, and then when they find out I'm vegan, they often blame it on that. Like ooooh that must be why, like it all makes sense now. Like no...this is an incurable chronic under studied condition. Its not because im vegan.  It's really ironic because this mostly comes from unhealthy people themselves who don't eat a particularly healthy diet, as I work with them. I see what they eat. They are often not very educated in nutrition. I am. I get my blood tested regularly. I have no deficiencies. My iron is 57 while my vegetarian and meat eater sisters is 8 and 13, and I had been telling them to get their bloods tested for years but they ignored me.

It's just so frustrating. I don't have this illness because veganism. I get all my vitamins and minerals. I supplement correctly etc. I am very into nutrition and listen to nutrition podcasts everyday. I know more about my health than most people, most of the people who say this probably have never even checked their blood. Could easily be vitamin d deficient in this winter weather and have no idea...but i do.. because I check.

Yet they find out I'm vegan and they're like OOOH that must be why. It's just so frustrating. No. You can be perfectly healthy and be vegan. No you can have a chronic health condtion and it not be caused by veganism... 

Veganism isn't really that hard. Everyone makes it out like it's so dangerous and needs to be very well planed.   Eating Macca's and KFC everyday is pretty dangerous...

Just eat a variety of vegetables and fruit , supplement b12, omega 3, maybe vit D( depends on ur country and sun exposure) and get your blood tested( which I think everyone should be doing atleast yearly)...  its not rocketscience.

Do you always find yourself repeating the same things over and over again when talking about veganism on reddit? How many times have you explained that plants don't feel pain, that animals are supplemented with b12 anyway, or that most of the soy is fed to farm animals, or ... you get the idea.

We are happy to announce a bot by [Vegan Hacktivists](https://veganhacktivists.org/) that can do all that for you! Freeing up your valuable time for more nuanced and complicated topics!

**How does it work?**

Simply **reply to a post or comment** that contains common vegan myths, provide the bot with a hint of what the myth is: u/animalsupportbot soy farming or u/animalsupportbot protein for example. You can also provide multiple hints when there are multiple myths to bust! ASB will then respond to the same person you responded to directly!

*Your hints help it detect that particular myth, but doesn't determine the bot's responses. For more examples of its behaviour, check out* [*r/testanimalsupportbot*](https://www.reddit.com/r/testanimalsupportbot/)*.*

**Important:** When you call u/animalsupportbot, you need to *directly reply* to the post or the comment you want the bot to respond to. If you simply call the bot in the post directly, the bot will respond to the post. But if you call the bot as a reply to someone else's comment, they will respond to them.

**The bot is currently available on the following subreddits:**

* [r/Vegan](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/)
* [r/VeganActivism](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeganActivism/)
* [r/AnimalRights](https://www.reddit.com/r/animalrights/)
* [r/ZeroWaste](https://www.reddit.com/r/zerowaste/)

We are working to get it available in more subreddits, let us know which ones you'd like it to be in!

**This bot is powered by a machine learning model**, and will learn and get better with time. Help us train it by upvoting it when it is responding with the right argument, and downvoting it when it is responding with the wrong argument.

The responses are written by our wonderful team of volunteers as well as volunteers from reddit (thank you all)! Contents of responses will not be trained when you up/downvote. And you can contribute to our knowledge stores yourself [in our github here](https://github.com/veganhacktivists/animalsupportbot).

It was alright. I mean, there are so many people here so experiences will vary. 

But it's so catered to America which is not surprising because the Internet feels overwhelmingly American. And if there are any Indians or Indian residents, they're mostly dominant caste Hindus. I am an oppressed caste Hindu and... it gets lonelier. 

I get talked over by dominant caste hindus in real life and here. There is no escape. And no one bothers to educate themselves because it doesn't affect them and to many, it gives them undue privileges too. And then I get shit on by my fellow people for being vegan because it makes me look like our oppressors who weaponise lacto-vegetarianism against our culture and used it to oppress us. 

I haven't found any allyship here, let alone a person like me. And it's traumatising to argue about this because for me it isn't data--it's real life, real experiences. I already feel pretty alone in college since there are so few Bahujans like me and all the dominant caste people try to make me feel I don't have the 'merit' to be here. They treat people from my community who are poorer and more vulnerable than me so despicably, I cry every other day. I stand up for those I can but it's hard when it's people who are more powerful than you professionally who do this and you have no one like you in a situation of power.

They objectify me too, especially the men. The objectification is different when you're Bahujan and a woman.

Yesterday, my professor was displaying pictures of poor advertisements and used PETA twice, and then only mentioned issues like child and domestic abuse briefly.  I thought this to be odd given that it was an english professor who mentioned they previously went to Johns Hopkins for medical school.  I assumed with their background they may be slightly more open-minded.  However, they continuously reinforced the students arguments who said the PETA ads were poor, and then dismissed any arguments that I or my peers made arguing for the effectiveness of the ads.

The first advertisement implied a human eating an animal that ate other animals to communicate the hierarchy of the food chain.  The second advertisement showed a baby in place of a seal that was clubbed with blood coming out of it (Which I understand may be too head on for some people).  I would say what upset me the most was not that she chose the ads as examples of what not to do in advertising, but when three other students argued that although the advertisement may be jarring, she dismissed these students and shook her head when these students said or implied that animal lives are equal to human lives.  I made an attempt to encourage or defend my classmates arguments (Which at first I planned on being silent because I thought no one would say something).  I would expect this from students in my STEM courses more so, but it was an upper 1000 level writing composition course, and it was the professor, not the students who was pushing against this.  

&amp;#x200B;

I recognize that opposition to vegans and their views is widespread, but I think I was more so taken aback by someone in an institution for higher education being so close-minded to other views.  Even more so when in college the aspect of being mindful of other's demographics and backgrounds is supposed to be a crucial element to the learning experience.

He acknowledges the hypocrisy of his love for animals versus his diet, and agrees with cognitive dissonance. We openly talk about it, and he doesn't mind watching videos or reading books on his own about it.

He does still want to eat meat and animal products, so has no plan to stop. I understand its his choice. I mentioned having a vegan household with any future family I would have - he welcomed it and said he could think of no reason to claim it as a bad idea.

The other night, he said that if we were to one day have a farm sanctuary or just a small rescue farm(one of my dreams) he would take care of the animals as pets, yet still eat steak elsewhere, etc. He didn't skip a beat when saying that. For some reason, this became my breaking point. For someone to be in that particularly close-knit situation with those animals and still eat them has bothered me to the point where I want the relationship to end.

I have not asked him to change his answer, or asked him to become vegan. I am not that kind of person, I would also never cease to have anxiety of whether or not he's resentful for settling, which would be a total disaster of misery for us anyways. I shared that for whatever reason, that particular scenario and his fast response just struck me differently, and I wanted to separate from him. 

In response to that, he wanted to ""bargain"" or compromise so that we could stay together. He implied that his compromise would be to slowly become vegan, to avoid the entire plausible farm animal/meat issue. I told him I had nothing to bargain, only this core issue that is just too much to be around and constantly think about. What am I supposed to change about that? Nothing. He got the point, but now claims he still wants time to think about other options and possibly change his view towards veganism.

Here are my concerns...at this point, if he chooses to become vegan down the road, that's not even genuine, right? I fully believe that he needs to make a choice HE wants to do for himself, and that he is passionate about and true to. However, its now clear that becoming vegan would be soley to keep us together - thats a MAJOR lifestyle change that his philosophy, empathy, and values do not line up with. Is that not a recipe for a relationship disaster?

I know myself and am now aware this is a deal-breaker. Should I be this cautious if he says he may change his mind about eating animals? I'm stuck, and know I'm stubborn by assuming there's no way he can become vegan in this forced event, and actually believe the ethics and values of that.

Hello! I'm on the road to veganism right now. The only thing left to give up is the coffee creamer with the unneeded dairy in it, as far as I know.

I'm physically disabled + have many GI issues. I take mostly liquid medication through my feeding tube. However, some medications/supplements are OTC only, and if it's not available in liquid... My only other options are to I can only take dissolvables, chewables, and gummies (because chewable and basically liquify with enough chewing).

So I look, and I know that gelatin is generally made from animals. However, my gummies are marked ""vegetarian""... Spring Valley is the brand. Google is giving me no answers, and I figured I should ask people who know much more than I do.

I started making my own cashew milk a couple months ago because I was concerned about the packaging on other nut milks (tetrapak, plastic bottles) and the price was getting really high.

What I didn't know was that cashews are high in oxylates and can be problematic for those who tend to form urinary/kidney stones.

What Happened:

At the end of June, I got a ""bladder infection"" on a Sunday morning and used a teledoc to get an antibiotic prescription. I took the drugs and went on vacation for 10 days, where I didn't have access to nut milks. I felt fine.

I came home, made some more nut milk, felt a little off. Ran out of cashews and started subbing with coconut milk. Returned to feeling fine.

Got some cashews, made cashew milk and about 5 days later got another ""bladder infection."" Used the teledoc again (again it was Sunday!) and took 5 days of bactrim. But I still felt bad, like my bladder was irritated. I made an appointment with my primary care doc and went in.

As I drove to her office, I started thinking about the timeline and what had changed recently. 

The cashew milk was the likely culprit. The oxalates were irritating my bladder by binding with calcium, which was acting like sandpaper in my urethra. Nifty.

Almond milk is also high in oxylates, even higher than cashews.

Most people don't have to be concerned about this, because only 10% of people are prone to kidney stones. Cashew/almond milk is nutritious and safe for most people. 

Here's some more information:

‚ÄãWhen constructing an ideal society, it is often suggested that you stand behind a ‚Äúveil of ignorance‚Äù to critically assess what is ought to be considered just. Behind this veil you cannot see who you are. You are blind to your race, gender, age, ability, intelligence, and religion. John Rawls, an American Philosopher, proposed that this is the ‚Äúoriginal position‚Äù, which will now be written ‚ÄúO.P.‚Äù. Only from this O.P. are we equipped to develop a social contract. 
The social contract will outline how we, as a society, should function. It is imagined, but the world we live in reflects the social contract we all hypothetically signed.  The beauty of this contract is that it assumes a society consists of moral agents. This is not to say it consists of morally ‚Äúgood‚Äù actors; however, many of these agents seek moral truths. In addition, the agents should be in pursuit of a society that accurately reflects their core beliefs. 
One of the most obvious examples of the social contract being altered is slavery. Slavery ran rampant through much of the United States until its abolition in 1865. As members of society, many demanded change as they felt the ownership of other humans was against their core beliefs. You would be hard-pressed to find someone to disagree with this take today, but in the 1800s this notion was enough to cause a war. In the era of slavery there was an enormous amount of friction in dismantling the social contract that allowed for slaves. 
How were so many morally righteous people complicit in allowing slavery before it ended? When groups are forming, the actors know who they are. The white men developed rules that suited white men. The marginalized black men, women, and children were left helpless to their prejudicial policies. This kind of oppression is the natural result of drafting a social contract given who you are. This is where the veil of ignorance earns its keep. Being blind to who you are will lead to unbiased principles of justice. Its purpose is to act as a thought experiment. The typical slave owner, upon consideration of their actions, will see no issue because they stand no risk to be marginalized. If they were to consider this issue of slavery from behind the veil, they would surely conclude that slavery is not something a just society should stand for. After finishing the thought experiment, they would be morally obligated to change their behavior despite their thoughts on the matter otherwise. 
‚ÄãI previously stated that the veil is meant to prevent you from knowing your race, gender, age, ability, intelligence, and religion. This list should be expanded to include ‚Äúspecies‚Äù. Of all the oppressed groups, there is none more ignored than animals. More than 41 billion animals have been killed in the United States for food this year alone. These animals‚Äô lives are wrought with emotional and physical abuse.
Cows are forcibly impregnated to induce lactation. They have their calves stolen from them less than a day after birth. All of this so that we can put creamer in our coffee. That same cow, who lost her child, might have her neck slit and her corpse skinned so that we can wear Air Jordans.
When chicks are born, they are sexed. If they are male, they are deemed unprofitable and are sentenced to gas chambers or meat grinders where they are killed. If female, they will likely spend their entire life in a cage, without being able to spread their wings, so that we can eat KFC. 
This is unnecessary and cruel. These animals are deserving of moral consideration in the same manner dogs and cats are. I would wager that you agree with me even if you are not aware of it. If you saw a pig being beaten in the street, you would be overcome with emotions of anger and confusion. You might even try to stop the assailant while seeking to protect the pig. When you see a pig on your plate, you don‚Äôt. You see pork. I think we should do better to stand behind the veil and consider what we truly think non-human animals are deserving of.
Please take a minute to stand behind the veil and consider the following questions: Are non-human animals deserving of moral consideration? Is slaughtering a sentient being to improve the flavor of a dish justified? If you had a chance of being a non-human animal, would you be ok with the way you would be treated? Your honest conclusions should drive your actions when you emerge from the veil. We are the only ones who can drive change in the social contract. The first step is seeking truth. The next is to align our actions with what is just.

The issue I have that has me stuck is that my cat had a urinary blockage a bit before I went vegan, spent multiple days in the animal hospital, but did recover. Seeing him in that much pain and fear was a nightmare, and something that I cannot put him in the risk of going through ever again.

In a perfect world, I would feed him a vegan diet and it wouldn't come with any heightened risk of urinary blockages, but it really doesn't seem to be the case currently. If there is ever lab grown cat food, I will be jumping in line so damn fast (I'm watching the work of [because, animals](https://becausemeat.com) very closely). I spoke to the animal hospital about the prescription recently, and they were adamant that he needs to be on this food for the rest of his life  :( 

On a solely personal basis, I hate the idea of feeding him animal products for the next decade or so, but I feel like I don't have any other option, and it makes me feel very guilty and sad knowing where his food comes from. Sometimes I question if I'm really vegan (not that that should really mean anything...)

Basically just looking for advice, support, or opinions on this type of thing...

I don‚Äôt visit this subreddits very often , mostly because I can feel an anger well up inside me when I see the ridiculousness vegans face. 
I learned that the friend who taught me about veganism converted back after 17 years of being vegan. 
She gave arguments I could not believe she thought were convincing. I gave mine, which were not surprisingly very similar to hers when she was vegan. There were a few other psychological components I won‚Äôt get into here, but the major bomb was that she was steadfast in her resolve. 
This post is meant to reach out to all of you who converted as a result of interaction with another. 
Know your reasons and check them often.  Make sure your foundations are strong. Had I been even slightly weaker, I may have broken then.
We derive strength from mutual support, but each one of us must stand strong independently, or else have our instability tested, and found wanting.

For me, the ultimate foundation is reduction of suffering.  If I can live well without increasing the suffering of another being, why should I cause the unnecessary suffering? There is no good answer to that question.

I will include here that I still love and respect my friend. I told her that if she could deliver an argument that would free me from my apparent delusion (from her perspective) I would accept it. I believe we ought to treat each other with kindness and respect as much and as often as possible.",vegan,The friend that converted me converted back,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/wdauut/the_friend_that_converted_me_converted_back/,True

""Room of Death"", the showroom of dead wildlife bodies posted on Rachael Keller's FB indicates how cold-blooded the human-supremacist is when killing for happiness. Rachael Keller is Fmr US SOS Mike Pompeo's new daughter in law. The specimen of animals Rachael's family callously hunted include lions, bears, wild bulls, elephants and white-tailed deer, to name a few. The heartless animal abuses, together with their contemptuous remarks, show how little they concern about animal lives, much less animal rights. What really makes my blood boil is the fact that they kill animals not out of necessity, but merely for ""fun"".

Moreover, there are reasons to suspect that they are possibly involved in illegal international wildlife transportation (from Africa to the USA). International trade in ivory was banned by the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species in 1989.

Diane O‚ÄôGuerin, Membership Correspondent at PETA Foundation, shared her opinions on this. ""Hunters whose social media accounts depict them smiling ghoulishly next to animals‚Äô dead bodies are only interested in slaughtering exotic animals for cheap thrills and in desperate quests to secure fame,"" She says. ""Hunters often argue that they are managing or conserving wildlife, but claiming that hunting somehow helps animal populations is as ridiculous as saying that killing people is a solution to world hunger. Killing one member of a species doesn‚Äôt save that animal‚Äôs life or the lives of others in that animal‚Äôs herd or pack.""",vegan,"PETA condemns Rachael Keller, a trophy hunter!",https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/wdb807/peta_condemns_rachael_keller_a_trophy_hunter/,True

But she herself is not vegan. 

A couple days ago she made a post talking about how dairy affects her skin negatively, but she loves the taste of cheese, so she eats it anyways and deals with the repercussions. Knowing that she‚Äôs not vegan but is seemingly educated on the topic, I sent her a message inquiring about her thoughts on veganism, animal exploration, and if she‚Äôd consider going vegan. I made sure my message was respectful, didn‚Äôt make any assumptions or accusations, and was otherwise non-aggressive (not trying to ‚Äúconvert‚Äù her, just open a discussion on the topic). 

She blocked me. 

I wish I had saved the message I sent because I can‚Äôt even analyze it to see how I might have offended her.

I have been supplementing this meal plan with a small daily portion each of mixed fruits, nuts, flaxseed, and green tea. I thought that should pretty much cover it because how varied do I have to get to meet my nutritional requirements?

But then I read their FAQs which said ""If you are on a plant-based meal plan, we recommend taking Omega 3‚Äôs DHA &amp; EPA, Vitamin B12, Iodine, and Vitamin D to cover common deficiencies seen on a vegan diet."" I also told my girlfriend who's a nurse that I started a vegan plan and she said I needed to supplement Vitamin K2 because the body intrinsically produces only a bare minimum and there are studies showing more is better. She is really pushing the vegetarian diet with dairy products is better. So then I went on the Internet and there are all these websites with different opinions on a bunch of different nutrients and I am confused now. One of the websites told me to eat natto which is rotten chickpeas covered in mucus. That's a hell no from me, sorry. I do not want to take any pills or eat weird things like algae and seaweed.

They call upon the experiences of tribes and those not in contact with the modern world - know, something they aren't a part of - to argue against veganism.

But they are missing a key point. Eating meat is more privileged than eating vegetables.

When a tribe who has never been in contact with the modern world, such as those on North Sentinel Island, kill an animal for consumption, they do so with primitive tools. In a life-or-death situation, one may find themselves killing an animal with their bare hands to survive. The chances of a human besting an animal in one-on-one combat, especially something large like a cow, are rather small. I honestly think a single cow would destroy me in a fight and I'm no slouch.

Meat eaters in the modern world we currently live in get their meat from someone else who kills the animal using a gun, tool or a specially designed gas chamber. This makes killing animals on a mass scale easy and leaves no danger at all to the human.

The fact that someone can go to their local shop and buy something such as meat, which their ancestors would have risked their life to get, and so do those in these tribes they seem to care so much about, shows how much of a privilege it is for them.

Additionally, the ethical situation is also one of privilege. They are able to be involved in the killing of a living being with no implications or negative consequences. In fact, they are praised for doing this.

This argument that veganism is a privilege is not only incorrect, but in my opinion, it is the complete opposite of the truth.",vegan,Opinion: Meat eating is far more of a privileged position than veganism,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/wdleur/opinion_meat_eating_is_far_more_of_a_privileged/,True

pets are only pets because they've been domesticated over 5000 - 10000 years (cats, dogs relatively). This basically means if it wasn't for humans forcing them into something that's not originally in their nature, and continuing to do so, they wouldn't have been pets in the first place.

Any argument that says this is how it is now, too late to change, they are dependent on us, is as stupid as carnists saying ""but we've eaten meat for so long, can't change that"", or ""farm animals are bred for food, it's been like that always"" NO it isn't. You can change, and so should the enslaving of pets. Poor things, we made them dependent on us over time.

In fact, whether it's a cage, pen, a room, or a house with locked doors, you're trapping your pet in a prison. Would they stay there if everything was open, would they come back, if they do, is it dependence, goes back to the above item.

I went vegetarian as a child and it took me another 10 years to confront just how awful the dairy/egg industries are and go vegan. I have since been vegan for around 2 years. After going vegan, it hit me like a truck just how easy it is for humans to disregard and ignore the suffering they force on others if they can't see it. As a result, I have become hyper fixated on altering my personal choices to align with my beliefs and switched my mindset on veganism from 'an all or nothing attempt to eliminate non-human animal products' to 'a continual effort to learn about the impact of my decisions on other people to eliminate as much misery as I can from my lifestyle'.

For example, I have removed the following for ethical/environmental reasons:
1. Any and all products produced with slave/sweatshop labor (phones, most clothing)
2. All single-use products that are not produced locally (avocados, lots of fruit)
3. All animal products or products that require animal testing
4. All products from companies that produce other products that do not fit these conditions (most plant based brands)
5. Any single-use products with any amount of plastic (damn near everything)
6. Any product whose production has a significant negative impact on the environment (palm oil, debatably almonds)
7. Products from companies that suppress unions (amazon, kellogs, ect)

I mention all this because my family and friends have become increasingly worried about my exclusionary lifestyle, as it greatly interferes with daily activities and clearly matters a lot to me. I've had my diet linked to eating disorders and many have said that it could be a symptom of mental illness. From my point of view, I am only doing what I think is ethical, but the increasing doubt from the people I live around and the lack of people that agree with my principles has definitely hurt my motivation and has me slightly worried about my mental health.

TL:DR;
I have cut around 99% of all products out of my life for ethical/environmental reasons and it worries my family/friends. Am I crazy or just obsessive?",vegan,Exclusionary Lifestyle,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/wdmfs8/exclusionary_lifestyle/,True

L is an older lady who used to be vegan but now follows a gluten free, non GMO, organic, cage free, grass fed, etc diet. S is a guy about the same age as me (I'm 35) and eats meat.

I mentioned I was going to have a get together at the park in a couple weeks and was inviting them, and that it was basically going to be a potluck and all I asked was that any food they brought have an ingredients list because there were going to be a bunch of people coming, some of whom have allergies and dietary restrictions.

L asked if it was strictly vegan, knowing I'm vegan, and I said I didn't really mind what they brought as long as it was labeled. S is kind of a newer friend and apparently didn't know I was vegan and he said something along the lines of ""humans are meant to be omnivores, you can't get proper nutrition without supplements if you don't eat meat"" I proceeded to reply with my basic go to response to that, which is that historically speaking humans didn't have access to as varied a diet as we do now, but now there are very few barriers for people in most decently developed countries to adopt a plant based diet and still get proper nutrients, proceeding to list sources of iron and B12 in a vegan diet. He responded ""animals are plant based, they eat plants."" I said that part of being vegan is caring about the health and wellbeing of the animals and that harming animals was wrong. He responded that they're already dead, might as well not let them go to waste.

Up until this point L had remained fairly quiet, knowing that I am capable of having this conversation without losing my cool, but then she piped in with her ""I feel so much healthier now than I did when I was on a vegan diet"" stuff about GMOs and gluten are the enemy and all the hormones and antibiotics and crap they give animals that aren't free range and how she gets her meat from a locally owned small place and.....

I wait.... When an opportunity arises where I can speak again I say ""but don't you care about the pain and suffering of the animals? Is it ok to kill them when you don't have to?""

S pops in ""you kill plants, don't plants deserve to live?"" I say ""plants aren't sentient"" S ""how do you know? Grass screams when you cut it""

The objectives of the initiative are:

1 - Exclude livestock farming from list of activities eligible for agricultural subsidies and include ethical and environmentally friendly alternatives, such as cellular agriculture and plant proteins.

2 - Incentives for the production and sale of plant-based products and those made using cellular agriculture. 

And to be as clear as possible I added them to the post I made. This is one response I got like an hour ago (translated as accurately as possible from Spanish to English):  


&gt;""Of course, the term cellular agriculture sounds much better than synthetic meat. Basically what is proposed is to move from the traditional agricultural system to the production of animal protein in the laboratories of the multinational pharmaceutical companies to feed those who have fewer resources, because those who have money will continue to buy meat. It is a good attempt by the capitalist macro-corporations to swell us with synthetic meat of poor quality and continue to enrich themselves, I remain on the side of the small farmer who gets up every morning to produce food.""

I don't want to leave it unanswered but I want to give as many arguments and counter arguments as possible, not only for this person to read them but mostly for the potential other people that would read that stupid reply and go ""oh yeah...they have a point, I won't sign then"".

I was really excited to try this and did loads of research, for example using nutritionfacts.org and the Daily Dozen app.

What I'm finding is in practice it's much harder than I thought.

Example: today I had no idea what to make for lunch so I ended up making something pretty weird, and (I think) not great nutritionally speaking. I just fried a whole can of black beans, added some mushrooms and flavoured with some spices (cumin, paprika, chilli powder), and ate it with some wholemeal pitta bread.

For breakfast I had oatmeal with soy milk and blueberries, with flax seeds.

I can't help but feel this is just a huge carb fest and compared to what I'd usually eat. I know beans have decent protein in them, but it's still mostly carbs. 

I was planning on having tofu for dinner with rice and veg. 

What I'm finding really hard is not being able to eat eggs as I'd often have these for lunch, and also cheese for flavouring (my beans for lunch were really missing that taste).

**I want to carry on with this for ethical reasons, but I'm really worried I'm gonna end up malnourished by just eating loads of carbs, not enough protein, and missing out on loads of vitamins/micronutrients**

Can anybody comment with a link to something they regularly use to argue the case for veganism? Videos are most welcome, but also any articles or people you follow? As long as it can be linked to (i.e., doesn't need to be referenced) then we're all good.

Additionally, please feel free to comment anything, even if it's popular (like Earthling Ed) as it's more about what you use to help others see your point and not about being far along on the journey etc.

For me it's a sanity thing too cause if I can't eat homey food living in the US I'll go crazy, and so I have no choice but to cook and source ingredients. You can get everything from H Mart or online. 

In the past week or so we had:

*  Tons and tons of smoothies; sweet and cold respite in this hot weather. 
* [Potato soup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMEQKE-shJI) with beyond meat and bread; simple and hearty. 
*  [Pine nut noodles](https://www.mykeuken.com/2021/01/korean-pine-nut-kalguksu.html); cold noodles with amazing nutty flavor that's perfect for summer. 
* [Perilla &amp; Mushroom Soup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3Uufzd-Oug) with noodles; warm, very distinct flavor or perilla seeds, oozing in mushroom fragrance. 
* [Bahn Mi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=237yMvRwJgI&amp;t=295s); sweet, salty, spicy, and sour and just bloody delicious. 

I also often make vegan Bibimbap, spicy silken tofu stew, avocado &amp; soy sauce salad, rice or oats vegetable porridge with vegan kimchi and zhacai, veggie &amp; tofu curry, I mean hell there are even [mock kbbq](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5Qv9hpieV4) recipes online. There are also numerous types of vegan banchan such as [bean stalk](https://mixandmatchrecipes.com/korean-soy-bean-sprouts-banchan/), [spinnach](https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/sigumchi-namul), [radish](https://www.koreanbapsang.com/mu-saengchae-spicy-korean-radish-salad/), [bracket ferns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX4mFpauhzc). [Sichuan-style Eggplants](https://www.feastingathome.com/chinese-eggplant/) and [Chinese broccoli](https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-broccoli-stir-fry/) are nice too. 

And I'm not a master cook or anything that remembers all recipes. I linked Youtube videos for a lot of them cause I'm mostly just copying them. If I find a non-vegan, but mostly vegetable-based recipe that sounds delicious, the substitutions are so easy. 

* Pickled shrimp, anchovies for broth -&gt; veggie broth
* Umami taste (e.g. fish sauce) -&gt; MSG
* Ground beef -&gt; bulk beyond beef
* Meat oil -&gt; perilla or sesame oil
* Meaty texture -&gt; eggplants or mushrooms

Most of the flavour is going to come from:

* Broth: some combination of powdered veggie broth &amp; msg &amp; radish &amp; kelp &amp; mushrooms
* Sauces: Soy sauce (Chinese: dark &amp; light; Korean: stew soy &amp; regular soy &amp; traditional soy - but either Chinese light soy or Korean regular soy suffices usually), pepper paste, bean paste, hoisin
* Oil: pepper, leak, or garlic-flavored cooking oil or fragrance oils such as perilla &amp; sesame

And the worst part is that all the carnist foods are in pristine condition. Their frozen meals or ice cream or whatever have 0 visible ice crystals on them, their yogurt isn't ripped open and their boxes aren't smashed. Usually with the other stuff I can filter through the damaged ones and make it work (i dont care much about smashed boxes if the box didnt open in the process), but I just really want some veggie burgers or ice cream and it's not possible, since a thick layer of ice like that most of the time indicates that it thawed and refroze and I just don't trust that it's not spoiled.

Not sure how to do it other than supporting those who share or vent here. 
I see questions all the time from teens or young adults about situations where they were made to feel bad or awkward about being vegan. We‚Äôve all been there and I still feel bad in som situations. 
But I‚Äôm old enough and have my life together enough where I can remove myself from certain situations if I don‚Äôt want to be a part of it anymore. And no one can do anything about that. 
For instance, I went to a work dinner last year. It was a carnist place ofc and they said they could make a plant based seitan dish for me. I ordered it and it came covered in dairy cheese shavings. I didn‚Äôt touch it. But everyone else at the table turned their nose up at the seitan. I found myself in that very uncomfortable position of defending a dish I didn‚Äôt even like, that was made by one of their non creative carnist chefs! I but my tongue that night and laughed it off but I‚Äôve turned down every invitation since and now I don‚Äôt get them. I‚Äôm happy. 
When people visit me, I ensure anything they bring over is fully vegan. I‚Äôve been vegan long enough and am old enough now where I have learned to be diplomatic about it. My friends and colleagues even know to check on barnivore if they even bring over wine. 
I feel for the youngsters who find themselves unable to speak up like that. It comes with age, and I wish we could support them in the meantime. 
Anyway if anyone else has anything to add/say, please share.

We see each other at other times of the year too, but this is the weekend everyone keeps clear so we can all be together for a few days on a beautiful lake. It's always been my favorite time and something i look forward to all year. This year I was a bit apprehensive about it because food is a big part of the experience and this was my first time seeing my family, including my parents and siblings, since I went vegan. I knew there was going to be a lot of animal bodies and products being consumed. I knew that I wasn't going to be able participate in sharing food the way I used to. I was afraid of being judged and having to defend my choice, having animal products pushed on me or flaunted in front of me. I was even afraid that being around so much carnism would make me judgemental and critical of my family.

I was so pleasantly surprised! One of my aunts cooked a completely vegan shepherd's pie and lots of people tried and enjoyed the lentil curry I made. Multiple people remarked how healthy I looked and most were very encouraging and supportive of my veganism. I didn't have many judgemental thoughts, and those I did I kept to myself. The only time I talked about veganism was when I was directly questioned about it. One of these discussions didn't go well because the person who brought it up was pretty drunk and kept interrupting and talking over me when I tried to answer their questions, but I just walked away when I realized the conversation wasn't going anywhere. Afterwards, I overheard my brother and some cousins defend my position and say such flattering things about my intellect and altruism that I actually cried.

I went to lunch with my parents before I had to go to the airport to fly ""home"" and they happily agreed to try a vegan restaurant. Both of their meals included tempeh and they absolutely loved it, my mom said she's going to look for it next time she goes grocery shopping. Today, my dad even called to tell me that he chose vegan jerky over turkey jerky and that it was pretty good! 


I'm so happy! I don't know if anyone else in my family will actually end up going vegan, but just the fact that most of them accepted and even praised my choice to be vegan was gratifying.

When i started being vegan i didnt supplement for the first month because i figured i still had enough B12 from my previous omnivore diet. Here my skin was the best i ever had in my life.

Then i started taking 300 micro gramms (one pill) of Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) daily. The pimples came back. Not terrible akne but 2,3 pimples every other day. 

This made me curious and i stopped taking the supplement for 3 days. Pimples vanished. Amazing skin again.

Now i read that taking too much vitamin B12 can produce pimples and even lead to akne but on the other hand i'm still paranoid of not taking enough.

So how much B12 is enough and how much is too much? Do you have experience with other forms of taking B12? Anyone found a solution for the pimple problem?",vegan,What's your experience with B12 supplements and pimples?,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/v2iahj/whats_your_experience_with_b12_supplements_and/,True

Some of them do taste great, but I find them to be more the exception than the rule.

So I‚Äôve tried just about every vegan protein on the market. And here is my subjective list of their flavor profiles, from MOST noticeable flavor (bad) to LEAST flavor (good):

**Pea protein**: I find it really hard to mask this stuff. Caramel/pumpkin spice sort of works, but you can usually tell when you‚Äôre drinking pea protein. That‚Äôs not a good thing.

**Soy protein**: Not as obnoxious tasting as pea protein, but it‚Äôs chalkiness leaves something to be desired. 

**Hemp protein**: This is where things turn a corner. You can definitely taste hemp protein, but it‚Äôs manageable. For an added level of neutrality, look for hemp heart protein. It‚Äôs powdery white and is much more neutral than pea or soy.

**Peanut protein**: OK, so you definitely taste this, but the taste is so pleasant that it deserves a spot near the top of the list. If you‚Äôre a fan of peanut, you can safely add as much of this stuff as you want and it‚Äôll never taste icky at all. 

But recently, I‚Äôve discovered my absolute favorite vegan protein powder‚Ä¶

*Pumpkin seed protein**: You can barely taste this stuff. Like at all. Most protein powders start to taste a bit obnoxious after adding 30g or so to your shake. Not this. I‚Äôm easily adding 15-20g of protein to my shakes without any noticeable change in flavor. Game changer.

What do you guys think? I‚Äôve found that a key to improving my fitness goals is finding protein shakes I‚Äôm actually happy to drink, and finding neutral flavors has been essential to creating those recipes. 

It‚Äôs tough to reach the recommended 0.8-1.0g of protein per pound of body weight benchmark on a vegan diet. Hopefully this will help!",vegan,My quest to find the best tasting vegan protein powder,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/v2khp6/my_quest_to_find_the_best_tasting_vegan_protein/,True

Well, here‚Äôs my story.

Last fall, my bf and I went to a party for a religious holiday - not a major holiday but a nice reason to get together and celebrate. A mutual friend, H, was there. Neither bf nor myself are very close to H, but we both enjoy his company and he‚Äôs always been one to make sure everyone feels included. 

H brought some cookies to the party, which everyone raved about. He asked if I wanted to try, and I politely declined and explained that I was vegan. He apologized that I couldn‚Äôt enjoy, and said he‚Äôd make something vegan next time.

A month later, there is another party, and H came up to me a few minutes after my bf and I arrived to tell me he‚Äôd made two batches of cookies this time: one vegan, one ‚Äúregular.‚Äù I thanked him and told him how much I appreciated it. He told me it was pretty easy to swap out the eggs - he just used mashed banana.

I panicked inside for a second - I haaaate bananas. Like, in any form. I just cannot choke down anything with bananas, even if there‚Äôs just a small portion. 

I smiled and said I was so excited to try one. And so a few minutes later, I did. And... look, if you liked bananas or even felt neutral about them, you would love these cookies. But I just could not get past the taste. 

That being said, I wanted to show H how much I appreciated that he made vegan cookies so I could try them, so I told him I loved the cookie.

A few months pass, and this weekend bf and I threw a party for MDW. We invited H, and when he arrived, he handed us a tupperware full of the cookies - since he remembered I loved them so much last time! He then proceeded to tell the group that it‚Äôs his grandma‚Äôs recipe and how happy he is to be able to share it with friends.

Well, I think I‚Äôm a little bit trapped now. I do not like bananas, I probably never will, but I also value my friendship with H and if that means eating a cookie I don‚Äôt like that he‚Äôs so proud to share every couple of months- that‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôll eat the cookie. 

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one who has eaten a vegan dish with an ingredient they don‚Äôt like, because someone made it special just for them.

For me, the idea of lab-grown meat really grosses me out and I don't see myself ever trying it.

So I'm french and started making videos on YouTube to try and reach more people with my activism. I'm trying to attract people who are not already vegan so I figured using arguments used by non-vegans would be an attractive title and would also allow me to make an interesting point: veganism is not something that we do, it's something that we don't do, we refuse to harm, exploit and kill animals.

My goal is to make people understand that non-veganism is not something neutral, that it does impact animals negatively. The video is in french but I added english subtitles so hopefully it will be understandable.

Here's my video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzAQLETLMWA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzAQLETLMWA)

What do you guys think of this idea (and how I presented it)? I thought it was interesting and was also pointed out by Cosmic Skeptic in one of his speeches:

 [https://youtu.be/Rsaq78MlWQY?t=623](https://youtu.be/Rsaq78MlWQY?t=623) 

*¬´ Those who are paying for this don‚Äôt think they need to give an explanation at all, because it‚Äôs just a burger, right? It‚Äôs the vegans who are putting forward the affirmative case, who need to do the explaining. (...) If we‚Äôre going to make it anywhere as a movement, we need to fix this. Eating animals is not the neutral position. (...) When I refuse to kill another human being, I‚Äôm not doing something affirmative, I‚Äôm refraining from doing something and when I refuse to kill another animal, I‚Äôm not doing something, I‚Äôm refraining. Now, why is this important? Well, what is the biggest problem that the vegan community currently faces? If you ask me, it‚Äôs PR. We have a bad image. Whenever we get a mention in the news of social media, it‚Äôs always that we‚Äôre extreme, fanatical, we seem frantic, this kind of stuff. Now why is this the case? I actually think this is quite understandable when we consider that most people see veganism as the affirmative thing. Think about what we‚Äôre talking about, we‚Äôre talking about mutilation, bolt gunning, gas chambers, diseases, all kinds of horrible stuff ‚Ä¶ Of course the rhetoric is going to sound extreme, the extremity of our discourse is only reflective of the extremity of what we‚Äôre doing to animals. So once it becomes clear that veganism is a reaction to this rather than its proposition, then those people who are pointing their fingers at extremity will realize that actually they are correct to do so. They are pointing at extremity, but the finger should be pointing in the opposite direction.* ***When you realize that this all comes down to the fact that veganism is seen as (a/the) thing that‚Äôs done and eating meat is seen as a thing that‚Äôs not done, that‚Äôs where I think the basic problem lies.*** *¬ª*

I have posted about this account here before but it is so viscerally disgusting and evil that something must be done. This man needs to get some reprehension for the irreversible suffering and harm he has caused. 

This is the man I made a post about who murdered 2-day old calves and ate their hearts and testicles raw. Showing in his recent posts, he also cuts open pregnant animals and EATS their unborn children, raw. He is obsessed with violence and posts pictures of himself ripping open animals and smiles about it.

This man is genuinely dangerous and is completely deranged and does not have a shred of humanity in him. He must be published. We have to do something. Something personal. He can't just get away with doing this. 

If these were dogs or cats he were doing this too, something would have been done a long time ago.

And by most accounts, we keep growing (the vegans and the plant-based) at an accelerated pace, as does the interest around our lifestyle and our diet. **According to a few surveys and estimates found online, we might have grown as much as 3x-6x times over the 2010s (in the US and the UK).**

AFAIK there are no projections about where we might be by 2030, 2040 or 2050 but barring the nuclear apocalypse or abrupt civilization collapse, it's a reasonable, even too conservative estimate, IMO, **to assume a doubling of the vegan population every coming decade** (for at least a while) as climate issues become a more pressing concern on everybody's mind and veganism becomes more and more normalized and embedded in society. I have no doubt in my mind we will get to at least 10% of the population someday. For the sake of discussion, let's say we reach 10% in 30 years, by 2050.

**How will that world look like?** I'll start by quoting what I wrote to another user who asked me this same question.

When 1 in 10 people is vegan we'll

* start having political weight. **We'll become a block that cannot be ignored wholesale and to some extent has to be considered, courted or even appeased.** Consider the media and political weight of similarly sized minorities today: African-Americans in the US (roughly 13% of the population),  LGBT population in the US (5-8%), Muslims in France (roughly 5 to 10% of the population), Asian population in the UK (5-6%). **In fact, 5% seems to be the first significant achievement** on the way to political relevancy.
* Needless to say, there will be vegans everywhere. By 2050 the boomers will have almost completely extinguished as a generation, while Gen X will be elderly. Power will be in the hands of Millennials and Gen Z, who are also the most vegan generations ever (obviously). There will be vegans at every level of politics, from national politics to munipalities. **There will be many, many more vegan doctors, nurses, accountants, teachers, journalists, celebrities, chefs, entrepreneurs: 5x as many as there are today**.
* Vegan options will increase exponentially in restaurants and grocery stores.  It will be completely normal to find multiple vegan options everywhere. 
* Accommodations will be made in hospitals, schools and prisons.
* We might achieve protected class status, allowing us to report any targeted harassment as discrimination (my understanding is that this is already a reality in the UK). 
* The debate about animal rights will intensify to a considerable extent in the media because 1 in 10 people is really a huge amount of people. With the availability of lab grown meat to boot, I can see the wider meat-eating population being increasingly confronted with their choices in uncomfortable ways. Most people will identify as ""flexitarian"".
* **Animal welfare legislation will accelerate, subsidies might decrease or be scrapped, prices for animal-sourced meat and cheese will increase massively to reflect their environmental cost.**
* Maybe the most important bit of all: Every person will know at least a few vegans, most families will have a member or at least a relation who is vegan. Every class will have at least a couple vegan, plant-based or ""lab-meats only"" kids. Vegans will become embedded, a part of the texture of society rather than individuals at its ""fringe"".

This is really a number's game guys.

I have a really cool opportunity where I am coordinating a summer camp with over 100 students. However, part of my position will be the logistics around providing lunch for students. I'm very fortunate in that my food budget is moderately robust and we have the opportunity to not use the default school lunch system. I will be providing lunches for a total of two full weeks (10 days).

I am vegan and I feel like this is one of the few opportunities that I have to be able to use a position of influence to ensure that I am minimizing the exploitation of animals. While I know that I will never be able to convince my team to allow a fully vegan menu, I would love your advice as to what a potential set of lunches might look like that feature plant-based foods, with maybe even one or two fully vegan meals.

For reference, I've been a vegan for over 7 years. My husband, parents, and brother are vegan. I don't have any close vegan friends, but mine have always been respectful and accommodating until yesterday when my omni friend, her omni bf, and I volunteered at a sanctuary for pigs. 

After we volunteered, bf insisted that we had to get lunch at a meat-serving restaurant because he was craving pork. Friend told him that was fucked up, but he didn't stop talking about it, even though he knows I'm a vegan and watched me bond with the pigs. He eventually said that the pigs have already been killed, so there was no sense in wasting the food. After listening to him say disgusting shit, I told him, ""Your dollar is your vote. It's an economic system. You incentivize the killing by signaling that there's a demand."" He shut up for a minute, then started making restaurant suggestions, including one that had no vegan options. I told them to take me home. Friend says no and that they want to accommodate me, even though bf shot down my restaurant suggestions. Eventually, bf settled on a mostly veg restaurant because he knew they served meat. 

When we got there, he decided we'd sit inside without asking us (I wanted to sit outside), and he complained to our server that there weren't enough meat options for him, even though he knew it was a veg restaurant!! He ordered a vegan sub, complained that they couldn't make it with beef, then had them add two different kinds of cheese and bacon. I was so over both of them at lunch, so I just ate my food while they argued with each other. When I got home, I sent sanctuary pics to my vegan family. Their happy reactions made me feel a lot better, so I thought I'd send them to my partner's family because they like to know what he and I are up to. My partner's brother responds, ""Cute! I'll be hunting down their ugly feral cousins this summer."" And my heart broke. 

I'm generally shielded from omni nonsense, but I felt so hurt and angry by the way I was treated. I don't think any of my other omni friends would've insisted on eating meat after volunteering at a sanctuary, especially because they'd know it would upset me. And it disgusted me that my brother-in-law had to bring up killing animals when I sent innocuous pictures of pigs. I feel violated, disrespected, and angry. How do you deal with people being like this? I've already wasted a whole day being mad about it.

Tl;dr: I volunteered at a pig sanctuary with my omni friend and her omni bf. Bf was an edge lord who insisted on eating meat after the experience and was rude about it. I sent pics from the sanctuary to my hubby's family to show them what I'd been up to, and my brother-in-law brought up killing pigs.

A family member who is aware of my eating disorder made comments suggesting my veganism is just a cover for my ED.  

Basically, this family member suggested I am a vegan/environmentalist for all the wrong reasons.  He thinks I am doing it for selfish reasons and is upset because he thinks my selfishness is putting a burden on others who have to accommodate for me.

I like to think that having an ED just made me more aware of what I put in my body, and I realized I would rather not kill an animal when I could just eat a plant.  I try to convince myself I am in it for the right reasons, due to the cases where the vegan option is less healthy For instance, I would rather have maple syrup than honey even though honey is supposedly healthier.

I am also an environmentalist: I never use plastic bags, I only use my car if the location is &gt;7 or 8 miles away (otherwise I take public transport/bike/walk).  However, the family member also commented that walking/biking is just another extension of my ED.

I will continue to go to family dinners as I want to see my family, but I want to know how you guys deal with little comments like that. 

I just want to also say no one in my family makes jokes or debates about veganism, its just normal  and they provide vegan options for me and I bring stuff. 

It's just upsetting hearing people I love say these things.  I imagine it would feel the same for them if they heard some one say ooooo I brought a lovely big of dog for dinner, or mmmm this dog is so tender.

I went to Taco Bell for the first time in ages, I ordered a black bean Crunchwrap supreme with guac instead of sour cream and cheese. There I was, hauling ass down country roads so excited to take a bite (literally laughed to myself beforehand about how much trust I had to put into the employees for a closed item) alas, no beans and all beef. Disgusting, I had swallowed before realizing and I‚Äôm probably being dramatic but I still feel it in my stomach.

I‚Äôve been a vegetarian for 15 years, a vegan for almost a year and have worked in customer service. I understand mistakes happen, anytime I‚Äôve had to return food for something like this the employee apologizes and remakes it, Im always nice about it, never had a problem. Until this fateful night.

I went back through the drive through and told the speaker person there was a mistake, she barked at me to go to the window. I assumed they would want to see the other wrap and I would tell them the specifications at the window, she didn‚Äôt really give me an opportunity to say anything anyway.

They were busy and I realize I should have thought to say something about dairy at the speaker. I get to the window and asked for them to swap the dairy for guac, MrsShrek rolls her eyes at me and agitated says ‚ÄúIt would have been nice to know that!!‚Äù And the guy behind her tells me he had already finished making it.

As someone who doesn‚Äôt raise their voice often, I shocked myself stating annoyed and loudly ‚ÄúI came back because YOU messed up!‚Äù She rolled her eyes again and closed the window. It was this moment I realized I wouldn‚Äôt be able to eat the new wrap anyway without being absolutely sure no bodily fluids had entered it in vengeance.

She hands me the bag and says ‚Äúno sour cream, no cheese, good night‚Äù Unenthusiastically. I chose to say nothing, as I had no kind words. 

I decide to open the wrap to investigate, lo and behold there is a sprinkling of cheese inside. Two wraps wasted and an hangry me later I wrote a long detailed story of my experience to send to Taco Bell corporate. I know it doesn‚Äôt really matter, but I would like a refund at least.

SavannahBr,t2_6map3f04,1648815102,ttp6gn,1,/r/vegan/comments/ttp6gn/animal_rescue_needs_help/,1,"Hi everyone. I volunteer with Crazy Cat Lady Rescues (we also rescue dogs). We feed, spay and neuter, and provide medical care for 250+ stray cats and dogs in Rabat, Morocco. Moreover, we house, rehabilitate, and re-home over 50 cats and kittens in our shelter.

I am reaching out to say we urgently need help. Our focus is spay and neuter in order to get Morocco‚Äôs stray population under control. However, we simply cannot ignore the lives that are already suffering on the streets. The emergency cases we see every day are piling up, and our available resources are already stretched so thin. The cats and kittens that we do admit into our shelter (instead of re-releasing after neuter) are usually sick cats or orphaned kittens. Consequently, the veterinary bills for our rescue are quite high. At this rate, we simply cannot keep up with the demand. We are drowning under the weight of our bills.

We are in desperate need of medication and medical treatment for our shelter cats, as well as our emergency stray cat and dog cases. Cat flu is running rampant in Morocco. So many lives have already been lost, both on the streets and in our rescue. Recovery from this virus is possible. We are doing our best to get our sick cats to recovery so that they may live so see themselves in a forever and loving home. That means not giving up on them. We need to keep the ones who need it in ICU, and we can‚Äôt do that without help.

Finally, we are doing our best to keep the bellies of all of our street cats full, but our supplies for them are quickly running thin and we really need help acquiring new stock.

So, I am asking you all to please share our cause or donate if you can. Your support will truly save lives, and there are many lives that need to be saved. Please.

However I was a vegetarian and became a vegan a few months ago as dairy milk were making more mucus in my body due to which I was constantly having cough. Tried many different medicines for years but was relieved by simply removing dairy products from my diet as per naturopathy and ayurvedic recommendation which surprisingly worked like a miracle giving me results in less than a week!

Prior to that I also saw the cruelty in cow stables, even in a culture that reveres cows... They were not only being beaten up or abused but also the calves were not being let to drink the milk of their share and all animals were starving, bones of calves visible. The cows were being cheated upon as they would let a calves suckle for a minute so that the cows can not retract her milk and then the milk would be derived out of them. There have recently mob lynchings, police reports and riots in my country regarding reverence of cows but how come these people never gaze upon the unhindered cruelty for milk extraction.

But I have 2 doubts regarding being a vegan in my mind provided I can not revert being a non-vegan:-

1. I have seen reports and articles saying that vegans will be destined to suffer deficiency of microminerals which is different from the deficiencies of a vegetarian in that a vegetarian person can still live but the deficiency of microminerals leads to death.

-&gt; I do not believe that plants can not provide us all the nutrients of our need but I am still skeptical that is it the case that no region can provide all the nutrients of your need and that we will have to diversify our diet a lot and include exotic fruits and vegies out of the area that we live in to make up for them? That would make being a vegan very costly given the examples of natalie portman that I read long ago that she is a vegan but gets monthly/biweekly injections of nutrient doses to not suffer from deficiencies.

Along with this I do believe that anybody who does not eats meat is bound to be protein deficient, even an eggitarian if you will and that I will have to take vegan proteins for that and I will also have to look for plant based fat alternatives as I was relying on ghee and milk for my fat intake earlier. But I am not concerned about macronutrients, I am more concerned about the micronutrients... Also how to avoid phytoestrogens and the relevance of vegan meat?

2. If I imagine a truly vegan planet (human societies only) then how would come to be true? Like for instance we have a lot of farm animals so what will happen to them? That means natalism is an essential step to veganism without which nothing could be done. What other important aspects to bring about a vegan society, changes that would be necessary to convert the system into vegan?

Beings like those in the Hollywood feature film Independence Day. They are incredibly intelligent and far superior to humans. Since a death-defying U.S. president is not always available in a fighter plane, and this time no unrecognized genius cripples the alien computers with earthly viruses, the alien beings have defeated and imprisoned humanity in no time. An unprecedented reign of terror begins. The aliens use the humans for medical experiments, make shoes, car seats and lampshades from their skin, and recycle their hair, bones and teeth. They also eat humans, especially children and babies. They taste best because they are so soft, and their flesh is so tender. A human they are about to take out of the dungeon for a medical experiment shouts at the alien beings, ""How can you do such a thing? Don't you see that we have feelings, that you are hurting us? How can you take our children away to kill and eat them? Don't you see how we are suffering? Don't you realize how unimaginably cruel and barbaric you are? Do you have no pity and no morals at all?"" The aliens nod. ""Yes, yes,"" says one of them. ""It may well be that we are a bit cruel. But you see,"" he continues, ""we are just superior to you. We're more intelligent than you, we're more reasonable, we can do things that you can't do. We are a much higher species, an existence on a completely different level. And that's why we can do anything we want to you. Compared to us, your lives are hardly worth anything. Besides, even if our behavior is not quite right, one thing is certain: you taste so good to us!

I hated myself for it, but I couldn't stop. 

I'll be turning 30 in 45 days from now and I've given myself time until then to completely adapt to this lifestyle. I'm thankful that I'll be in the US for another two months, went to the grocery store today and stocked up on enough soy milk and almond milk to last me for a month's worth of smoothies so I won't crib about it. Now I just gotta stop myself from giving into my cheese cravings. Printed two pictures of baby cows from google images and pasted them on my work desk and refrigerator to keep reminding myself why I want this for myself and everyone else to begin with. 

I may fail. I hope I don't, but I may. But if I end up going through with this for one and a half month, I can stick to this for a lifetime.

I've went vegan last summer because it was only then that I was truly aware of the horrors of animal agriculture.  The fact that we commodify, exploit, and murder billions of animals every year is just something that I found morally abhorrent.  I've even watched Dominion and it almost put me in tears.  It's really insane how animals are treated.

But I've been spending some time on r/debatevegan and this one genius pointed out that it's hypocritical to be against animal exploitation and drive a car.  You see by driving a car, you sometime skill insects as they splatter to your windshield.  Why didn't I think of this genius logic before?  Like holy shit that blew my mind  Clearly I'm a hypocrite if I don't buy the products of exploitation and murder of the innocent while occasionally driving a car.  Absolute genius!  Also veganism isn't perfect, and it doesn't solve all of the world's problems.  So what's the point?  Another insight of absolute brilliance! 

So lately I've reintroduced some animal products back into my diet.  I bought some dog meat from [https://www.elwooddogmeat.com/](https://www.elwooddogmeat.com/) and I have to say it's amazing.

Reddit is bringing back its social experiment [r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/tqbf9w/bringing_back_rplace/)! ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_(Reddit)))

It allows everyone to contribute a tiny effort by colouring a pixel on a canvas, every once in a while.

Combining the effort of thousands upon thousands of players, a community could draw entire images, logo's, slogans, etc! So how about we get a great recognisable vegan logo and together make ourselves visible on [r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/)? If there are Software Engineers out there, bot or browser extensions to help with placing or do the pixel placing for us would be great! I think we can make this happen, but we do need to work together!

We could perhaps do something like this?

 [r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/) is live now!

He made a spreadsheet which we can use to determine the location of pixels, and from community suggestions I think the vegan logo is a very good thing to do! Recognisable, visible, easy to maintain and draw!!

 SEE HERE: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SG-7Zy81iTX4fPd4YX4kQafJADbEzXLRnuZ\_GEF4MOI/](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SG-7Zy81iTX4fPd4YX4kQafJADbEzXLRnuZ_GEF4MOI/)

Place the pixels corresponding to the numbers given in the spreadsheet, on the coordinates on the canvas, including the black border! Enjoy and **share** for more collaboration!

It was fucking goldfish! There's a picture of cheese on the damn bag!)  And then...blame me for not being vegetarian because, if I was vegetarian, I would've been able to eat it! Like what? How does that make sense?

Every time they do that they blame me for not just shutting up and accepting the ~gift~ and eating it to make it Happy. Excuse me? Like that's literally the point of veganism ‚Äî NOT eating it. Intentionally consuming it knowing there are animal ingredients is not veganism. Being *vegan* means doing it all the time without exception unless accidents or literally having no choice (ex. A life saving medication they inject you in a hospital you have to take but has been developed by a non cruelty free lab, or like idk your non vegan parents are using a non CF/V cleansing product in their house).
You can't be occasionally vegan, that means not being vegan.

Like that's the minimum when you have a vegan kid ‚Äî I'm not asking you to like cook my meals, but if you are deliberately choosing to get me something, get me something vegan??

Most of the people that give the greatest pushback against me are usually always someone with their foot in the door beyond that of your everyday carnist. They will fight tooth and nail going back and forth with me about the ""flaws"" in veganism and usually by the end of the  ebb and flow, reveal that they have some form of personal stake in the exploitation of animals.


Whether that means that they're an agricultural student, chef/culinary artist, hunter/fisherman, farmer relative/raised, beekeeper, or a for-profit breeder, I seem to always attract the attention of these people. They usually reserve it until the end and try to use it as some kind of trump card.

But honestly, Idk why they even bother telling me this information because I always call them out on it and after that it's usually one of two options, they either:

1.) Double Down

Or

2.) Don't respond ***crickets***

After that, I pretty much just watch them continue digging themselves in a hole or, in the case of option 2, some other perpetrator will chime in and the cycle continues with them.

They bought a bunch of meat, cheese, milk, etc. along with other supplies we needed. They then asked me to pay for half of it. I said, well, I'll pay for half of the total minus everything you spent on animal products. Seems fair, right?  
When going over the receipts just to get a rough estimate, they say that I am humiliating them by checking the receipts. ""Just give us less, don't check the receipts.""  
Again, I really wasn't trying to pinch pennies or anything. I just wanted to know roughly how much of the total was spent on animal products. (2/3 was spent on animal products, as I expected based on what I saw them bring into the kitchen.)  


Then I say: ""Look, I just want to not pay for animal products, isn't that ok?""

Them: ""Of course it is ok to not pay for them.  
We respect your decision to be vegan. But, why can't you respect our decision to eat them?""

YOU respect my decision because you think it's some dietary preference or something. Because my decision doesn't entail violence.  
I CAN'T respect your decision because I think what you are doing is condoning murder, rape, and exploitation.  
You respect my decision because you think it's merely a different preference, but I don't respect your decision because I think in my heart of hearts that it is WRONG.

""There are many ways to help animals, to help nature. You buy water out of plastic bottles. You smoke many cigarettes. We all have different opinions. We are older and you should respect us. Are you trying to change us?""  
I couldn't bother responding to this one. I realized there was no way to get through to them. They straight up think I am the bad guy. So I pull out half the total in cash and put it on the table, and they got SO offended and said ""don't throw money at us like prostitutes.""  
I just feel so fucking gaslit and so alone. These people - my own fucking family - ""love"" me, and they really do in some respects, but they also think I'm this disrespectful person who would dare try to ""change"" them even though all I fucking did was not want to pay for meat and look at the receipts.

I've tried on many occasions to talk to my family about this and even the few who are sympathetic and ""supportive"" and are like ""weekend meat eaters"" or whatever, idk, I still feel like I can't talk to them. Oh, and of course, they are happy to eat my food when I prepare some, and ask if they can. To which, of course, I always say yes! Because 1) I like helping people and feeding people, and because 2) I hope that maybe they'll realize goddamn I love this tasty food and it doesn't have any animal products, maybe I don't need to buy any!

I have no vegan friends in real life. I feel so alone. I live with a bunch of carnists and they make me feel like shit if the topic of me not eating animal products comes up. I so so so desperately wish I had at least one friend to talk about this with or to cook and eat with or anything. But I'm just so alone in this.

The WORST fucking part of this is that I LIVE IN UKRAINE and we are IN A WAR WITH AN EVIL DICTATOR, and somehow I'm sowing discord into the family when we need to be coming together and supporting each other in this incredibly scary time - and I genuinely DO feel bad about it, even though I never meant for this to spiral into an argument with yelling and whatnot. I just wanted to look at the receipts.  
They went out to stock up on a bunch of supplies because, you know, it's a fucking horror-zone over here, and instead of getting all sorts of canned goods and grains and dried fruits or whatever the fuck, they buy all this quickly perishable meat and cheese, and then act like this toward me.  
I'm just fucking disgusted and feel so alone just so so alone sometimes.  
I don't want to be gaslit into thinking I'm this corrosive force in the family.  
I can't fucking respect your desire to eat animals, I'm sorry. It's wrong.

And I just - I want to tear my hair out because I want to be able to be focused on this fucking war going on but they just hurt my feelings so bad today that I just keep thinking about it and they're slicing up some salami right now and eating it as they watch the news and I just want to vomit. Maybe the reason I'm focusing on this so much is because I haven't been able to focus on anything besides the war for the past 6 days.   


Anyway, thank you for listening.  
I wish you all peace and love from Ukraine, and please keep sharing and raising awareness of the atrocities that are going on here. Please help Ukraine.

I recognize enough sanctity in the life of an animal that I think it is perverse to kill an animal for one's sense of humor (I suspect most people who eat meat think so). Then, a reasonable argument (to my mind) is: ""If the life of an animal is sacred enough that you abhor torture or murder of that animal for recreation, then how is the torture and murder of that animal for one's appetite any better?"" Of course, if the consumption of meat is necessary for our decent survival or optimal health, then we should concede that we have no choice but to consume meat, whatever our feelings of kindness towards animals are. 

But consider an animal such as deer. If I should feel compassion and responsibility towards deer, then I should try to save deer from being cruelly hunted by humans (perhaps ideally through persuasion). But should I also try to save deer from being cruelly hunted by predators like wolves? Should humans (with their intelligence) rescue animals from the natural habitats where those animals are inevitably prey, and place them in safe havens where benevolent humans maximize their comfort? No person, however kind towards animals, believes this should be done. It would harm the predators. So, we accept that we should not save deer from being cruelly hunted by wolves, because that is the way of nature and part of the cycle of life. We cannot possibly have an absolute compassion and responsibility towards all animals. And, if this is so, why should humans not participate in this cycle also? Why not accept the cycle of life for our own benefit? Or why is the human who hunts contemptible, but not the wolf? This is a serious, not a smart-ass, question.",vegan,Serious ethical question:,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/t495gk/serious_ethical_question/,True

I don't need to have a low frequency of farting for all 24 hours of the day.

I work 8 hours a day. I'm around coworkers for 8 of these hours (I don't work alone).

I'm okay with farting stinky farts for the other 16 hours of the day. 

How can I time my eating of fart-producing foods (beans, alliums, cruciferous vegetables, bran, etc.) so that I don't fart near my coworkers? 

I've seen websites and/or videos on the internet about how long it takes for food to move through the digestive system, or how long it takes gas to form, but I suspect that those articles were written (and videos were made) with the omnivore in mind. I read that ""meat: it's what's rotting in your colon"". Meat tends to take a longer time to work it's way through your intestines than plant matter does. Most people in the world eat meat. So that's why I think those articles and videos might be inaccurate for vegans.

I've been a vegan for two years. Cooking abilities, in my experience, make the move to veganism quite simple.

According to me, Indian food (specifically vegetarian food) is 80 percent vegan by default, and the other 20% can be made vegan by substituting the components with vegan alternatives.

I started an online vegan cooking class 6 months ago with the goal of creating awareness about Indian vegan cuisine. 

I've already taught more than 20 lessons and am searching for more individuals to join the session.

You may see what you can expect from the class by looking at my pinned posts from my profile.

A little insight about the class.

Medium ‚Äì Google Meet (I would be sending the meet link few minutes before the class starts)

Capacity- 6-8 person in one class

Duration- About 1 ¬Ω hour. (There is also an Q n A session where I will be answering to your queries regarding anything food related)

Date and Time- 29th January, 4pm Eastern Standard Time.

Charges- 15 USD (via paypal) 

I would be teaching how to make Matar Tofu (Peas and Tofu in Onion Tomato based sauce) and Matar Pulao (Rice pilaf with green peas).

I would be sending the ingredient list in advance and the written recipe after the class ends

I picked this recipe because I feel it is the greatest way to introduce you to Indian food.)

My partner and I first got together a few days after I became vegan. At first, everyone brushed it off as a phase. Which isn‚Äôt exactly unlike me, I‚Äôve switched my major 3 times now soo I get it. However, I became militant with my approach to veganism (which I know is not for everyone but it worked for me). 

Our flat has always been animal-product free, aside from his old clothes and shoes, but six months ago I started asking him to try his hardest to avoid animal products all together and if he really wouldn‚Äôt give up fish and dairy, we could always come back to it when he‚Äôs ready. Perhaps this was the wrong way to go about it, but I began asking him what he ate that day and showed him horrific clips of how the animal came to be on his plate. I wouldn‚Äôt watch it, but I would play it and look away for a bit. This went on for about four months, in combination with trying new recipes and vegan versions of traditional Romanian food. Luckily, he‚Äôs open minded, supportive and didn‚Äôt think I was being too obnoxious (I can see how others would). 

He stopped eating and using animal products about 2 months ago, was firm when his friends would comment negatively about the change, and came to me when he slipped up. It was all very open and casual. We also put the clothing and shoes in a box to send back to his family to wear. We decided it could be used in a better way.

To my delight he came home last night to say the sight of meat on his friends plate disgusted and saddened him. Specifically ‚Äúdead bodies on a plate‚Äù. This was the same man who went into a butchers market  when we first started dating and when I said ‚Äúso much death‚Äù, he turned to me confused and asked me why I felt that way. 

Of course I‚Äôm not happy his appetite was ruined and he didn‚Äôt enjoy the dinner. But there was a certain point I wasn‚Äôt sure if his feelings towards animal cruelty were changing or he was simply trying to appease me. I‚Äôm glad it wasn‚Äôt that way. I wanted this change to be because he had changed his view, I know some people aren‚Äôt okay with being with a non-vegan but I would have compromised. 

Anyways, I‚Äôm so proud of him and also think that anyone can be shown a better, and less cruel, way to live  - including my Chinese (previously an avid hunting and fishing) father who convinced me to become vegan shortly after he did. He pretty much used the same method, sent me a few videos and that was it for me. We also didn‚Äôt have the best relationship, but this brought us closer together in a natural way. 

Just wanted to share my story but also wanted to show those with loved ones (that are receptive) that it can happen!

So I went vegan a little more than a year ago. It started as an environmental thing but along the way it became a moral stance for me. And I've been in a relationship for a few months, although I knew her and liked her for a lot longer. The thing is I never actually told her I'm vegan cause I didn't wanna make things uncomfortable. I didn't want her thinking I was judging her or something. I didn't wanna lose her, it may be psychotic but I love her. 
She probably just thought I don't like that stuff. Or that I'm plant based. 

But lately it's been really confusing for me. Being vegan and being in a relationship with someone who likes cheese and KFC. I felt like I'm not being honest and myself anymore. I love her ofcourse but I can't half-ass being against animal cruelty, I kinda feel stupid. And I'm really not judging anyone who is in relationship with a non vegan obviously. I really thought I could make it work myself.

So I told her that I am vegan today. She was cool with it. But i think we both knew things are gonna get uncomfortable. It's gonna go one of 2 ways 

She either transitions into being a vegan. I'm gonna try my best to explain her why I myself am vegan. And educate her about everything I've learnt so far.
I would also not want her to do that just for me. I want her to be vegan only if she thinks it's right.

Otherwise I'd have to tell her I can't be in a relationship with someone who contributes to animal cruelty. The thought of which itself really really sucks and I'm freaking out like crazy. I didn't know what to do so I came here and made a post about it. Typing it down made me a little calm. So thankyou if you read it, I hope it was somewhat entertaining or anything.

Happy new year to everyone! I just came back for a family dinner I was a little scared of having. It‚Äôs my first year as a vegan and the first festivity I actually spent with almost all my family. 

That said, my country is pretty big into meat and my family is not the exception. Festivities and barbecues are basically a common tradition. If you have something to celebrate (New year, Christmas, birthdays, a family reunion‚Ä¶) you are going to have a barbecue. 

Either way, I was really worried about the whole thing and how my family was gonna act. And yes, they were some stupid comments and jokes about not eating animal products, but overall it was pretty great. I brought a vegan lasagna, and some of my folks tried it out and loved it!

I was checking out [www.veganuary.com](https://www.veganuary.com) and it seems to put quite a lot of focus on the environment and what people eat, rather than the animal rights / suffering?

I thought the vegan philosophy was mostly about the animals and whilst us refraining from keeping and killing \~80+ Billion of them every year would reduce loads of other negative things (MMGW &gt; climate change , pollution), even if going vegan didn't have those benefits, we would still be morally obliged to leave the animals alone?

Or is it \*just\* marketing where they are trying all the angles in the hope that people reduce their meat intake for whatever reason on the grounds that that's the goal, even if not for the 'right' reason?

Personally, I think you can advocate for the abolition of the animal agriculture industry whilst still putting human lives first seeing as we can survive perfectly well without abusing animals. But other people think that our lives have equal value. So I thought I'd see if I'm really in the minority by using a thought experiment.

There's a trolley hurtling down a track, and on its current path, it would hit a human and a sheep. You have access to three levers. The first would transfer the trolley to a track which hits a sheep. The second would transfer the trolley to a track that hits a human. The third lever is unlabelled, and would randomly transfer the trolley to either the human or the sheep. 

For this thought experiment, you have zero knowledge about the morality of the human on the tracks. Any living creatures on the tracks would be instantly killed if the trolley hits them.

*Additonal information for those interested:*  
*Palm      oil is in  over 50% of products found throughout the UK and is    heavily   processed in  the western diet, this could reasonably be seen    as a  huge  health risk.*  
*This      research  is a small part of my PhD but a very important one, I am      looking at the  awareness of palm oil and palmitic acid throughout  the    UK  with a focus  on the differences based on age, ethnicity,  body     composition, physical  activity and lifestyle. This will really  help    when  I progress to the  next phase(s) of my research. Other  aspects of    my  research include a  systematic review with  meta-analysis, a fatty    acid  analysis, as well as  blood/stool  samples from participants with     differing levels of palm  oil  consumption.*  
*We     all know   palm oil is particular bad for the environment (and this    will  be   outlined heavily in my research), however, the main goal(s)  of   the    research is to determine 1) if palm oil is healthy/unhealthy,  as   the    literature does not provide a concrete answer at this time -  or    provides   contradictory statements/findings 2) at what level of     consumption, for   how long a period of time can humans consume palm     oil/palmitic acid   before it becomes a minor, or major health risk, 3)     is it more prevalent   in a vegan diet when compared with omnivore,     vegetarian pescatarian,   flexitarian etc 4) how does it affect brain     function, gut microbiome   diversity, metabolic syndrome/metabolic     health 5) is it beneficial for   some people, for example those with     ADHD (very little science on the   subject currently).*

Back when I was taking a gap semester from college (when I first went vegan), I was mostly whole-foods plant-based. I have PCOS, and still lost 15 pounds, ran 1-2 miles everyday, hiked constantly, and transitioned to strength training on a daily basis. It was the best I have ever felt in my life. I had a kitchen to cook in, parents to pay for groceries, and so many more luxuries that I desperately miss now.

I was vegan for over a year and then stopped because of how little food I was able to eat on campus. I am pescatarian now. 

I fell off of those healthy habits (I have ADHD, and I was getting fit for the wrong reasons). I have gained 30 pounds in the past year, so I am really ready to make a change. I really, really miss the feeling of being active, energetic, and ethically in tune with everything. 

I recently got an air fryer, mini fridge, and utensils/bowls/plates. Many women with PCOS have success by eating a low-carb diet. That is hard on a vegan diet, in a dorm room, without a proper kitchen, so any help would be appreciated. Recipe ideas, healthy habits, and any other advice is welcome. 

I am considering incorporating fish once a week as a low-carb/high-protein meal until my health improves and I start building healthy habits. However it isn‚Äôt necessary if I can get few enough carbs and high enough protein.

To start off, I was thinking of getting mason jars and prepping chia pudding with protein powder, seeds, nuts, and fruit to start every morning with a great meal.

A little over a year ago my toddler was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes on the same day I gave birth to my daughter. It changed my life and really woke me up to start looking at the health of my family. Now that I've gotten better at managing his blood sugars, I have some energy to start working on WHAT hes eating. Hes very picky, will ask to try food I'm eating and then go yuck! He doesnt like many fruits or vegetables, loves crunchy food and snacks. I'm trying to compromise and work towards getting both my kids towards more wfpb as much as I can. He does like pistachios dates and raisins, and sometimes will eat peas and corn. He loves these kodiak cakes big square waffles and I was thinking I could get a waffle maker and make and freeze some wfpb waffles for him, also a good way to sneak in healthier things I want in his diet like blueberries and bananas. So I'm looking for suggestions on waffle makers that dont need any oil to be nonstick. I need all the help I can get i want to set my kids up with healthy habits and the best chance at a long healthy life free of disease. I watched what the health the game changer and am listening to how not to die on audible. I have been wanting to go vegan for a while and had this idea that it wasn't right to make my kids be vegan but after seeing how bad it is for them I really want to eliminate as much dairy and meat as I can. They eat whole grain cheerios which has a lot of b12 and take vitamin d. I also think my 1 yo daughter has a milk allergy so I went fully vegan since I'm breastfeeding and it just so happens I was leaning that way anyways.

I did a blood sugar level trial recently and found that, for obvious reasons, mango and plums made my blood sugar levels rocket. Another meal that ranked badly was a lentil dish that I had with pitta bread. I'd made the dish from scratch and presumed it would be ultra healthy.

The foods that came up as good were Huel powder and Hoops, which are a type of crisp/chip made from reconstituted potato.

I haven't had the full report, so I don't have a longer list of foods, just the top and bottom three. I was meant to do trials of different foods in differing combinations to assess the impact, but when I had the first day of 40g plain oats with water, I was climbing the walls with hunger for the three hours until I was allowed my next meal, then I didn't have time before the blood sugar monitor ran out before I could do some trials with oats with things like nuts and fruit to see which combination is better for my blood sugar levels.

Feeling really deflated. When I stare at my cupboards I have so much food, but it all needs preparing. I just want something I can prepare in 5-10 minutes that is filling and satisfying and is whole-food plant based.

I can‚Äôt seem to find an answer to this after a lot of searching.  I want to do WFPB, but I am not a cook.  I also, quite honestly, just don‚Äôt want to use my time to learn how to do it.  Every ‚Äúeasy‚Äù recipe I read, still has things that sound complicated to someone like me.  Yes, I know I should learn but honestly, I also don‚Äôt want to take the time to learn or to cook.

Variety and taste really aren‚Äôt that big of a deal to me.  If it were a matter of eating avocados, celery sticks, and some boiled rice (I can at least boil something) every day for every meal, I seriously wouldn‚Äôt mind.  I just need someone/app/site to give me a weekly meal plan of almost literally ‚Äúno cook, no prep‚Äù, no matter how ‚Äúboring‚Äù or bland it is that gives me all the nutrients needed.

I keep thinking there has to be a solution for someone like me.  The closest I find is Huel (which I‚Äôd prefer not to do) or a Vegan delivery meal service that I just ‚Äúheat up‚Äù but there are environmental concerns there and I‚Äôm not sure if it is without oil and unprocessed.

Am I missing something?  I hope my request makes sense.  What I lack in a desire to cook, I genuinely make up for in my low maintenance when it comes to variety/flavor/excitement.  I could eat lettuce and apples and avocados all day long for ten years if I knew that would provide me with the nutrients needed etc.

Everyone first points out that Lead and Cadmium are 'naturally occurring', as if that's any better. They all say they are doing everything the FDA requires (which is nothing at all). Some of them refused to even show me a COA - others sent me an old or incomplete COA -- that showed pretty fuckin high levels of heavy metals in their spices. 

Another WFPBD user pointed me to this company - American Turmeric -- who test every batch they grow and put a lot-specific QR code on every package so you can see the COA. The levels of lead and cadmium are blessedly low. It's almost like medical marijuana. THIS is how you do it.

So that takes care of Turmeric and Ginger. But my god, I miss my other spices.

With hypothyroidism, I want to keep selenium in my diet, but limit biotin (prenatal vitamins aren't the best for this, they had everything I wanted minus iron).  I would rather avoid biotin. Definitely could use some iron, folate, and omegas. At 36, I have kinda bad cholesterol, unfortunately genetics &amp; my stupidity play a huge part in that for me; I eat a naturally low fat high fiber diet. I recognize I could be *a lot* better and am slowly working on cutting out soda and Starbucks, which are bad in excess, and I need to shore up.

Currently in the process of being diagnosed with autoimmune +/- central nervous system disorders, along with allergies to shellfish, all dairy, red dyes, eggs, soy, and all forms of wheat. Most fake meat products are out of my diet, I can have Quorn, Beyond Meat, and maybe one other. While I'd prefer to eat my vitamins, this is not a situation where I can. Trying to lose about 20lbs with a restricted caloric diet + low impact exercise/weights. 

I am open to taking multiple types of supplements to bring my levels up. I know gummy vitamins aren't as top tier as water-soluable, however I have a tendency to get random throat swelling so I choke on medication/food a lot.

I‚Äôm bringing forth this collection of scientific excerpts that provide evidence of a medically constitutional premise describing how the alkaline diet is successful in preventing disease and also preventing relapse of disease once natural herbs have been used to detoxify the biological impurities causing said illness along with an additional argument: Were all living things, including carnivores, vegetarian at one point in our prerecorded history? Of course, all love and credibility for the initial revolutionary body of knowledge is attributed to Alfredo Bowman and his beautiful family. I‚Äôm simply elaborating and providing my own perspective inspired by the trail of bread crumbs that had been left for us to follow on his behalf. Now that that‚Äôs out of the way, I‚Äôd like to begin by introducing the foundational ideology of the diet and it‚Äôs many remedial qualities as well a bit of history. 

#**Introduction**

The alkaline diet is not a modern advancement, but a return to form that is emulating our deep-rooted ancestral dietary consistency, beginning with the very first African people who were not predisposed to modern first world technology, animal meats, or the artificial and hybridized foods that are consumed regularly today. In achieving this you are focusing your diet around foods, measured by a pH scale, to be alkaline forming by nature which provide the essential groundwork for all consistencies found in the diet and its ability to prevent, reverse or even cure disease along with the help of herbal treatment. The food is the backbone of the entire lifestyle acting as a preventative measure which will regulate your health, efficiency, and homeostatic equilibrium once all artificial toxins have been cleansed from your vital organs and blood. The herbal medicine‚Äôs role lies in purifying and restoring the intracellular damage inflicted by modern agricultural advances and the many chemical, and animal derivatives that have been fed to us since we were children without us understanding the deleterious implications being proposed by such artificial substances. 

#**How Disease is Formed**

To fully understand how disease is formed we need to understand the basic mechanics driving what‚Äôs referred to as homeostasis: the relative balancing and regulation of biological processes based on the intracellular constants that constitute our overall health. Homeostasis is responsible for keeping us healthy because it makes sure we always have enough, and never too little or too much, of everything the body needs to survive, promoting a flourishing quality of life if nourished with the minerals our bodies are made of. If we do not consume or better yet absorb enough minerals, nutrients, and we consume too many toxins, the body then loses its grip and homeostasis regulation is essentially disrupted. This opens the back door for disease to form in the body due to homeostatic processes now assisting your death rather than your well being, through a gradual life-long cascade of cellular destruction. We are not however, focused on seeing dramatic influences to the surface pH of our blood or organs. The pH on the surface will remain relative to its regulatory pH while micro acids and toxins accumulate underneath causing intracellular harm. This is known as what I call the ‚ÄúBlood pH Misconception‚Äù.

Absorption, retention and consumption are very important terms when we acknowledge our nutritional health because no matter how much we consume we owe nothing to our bodies when nutrients are not properly absorbed or utilized by the cells, and no matter how much we absorb if we do not retain the nutrition our bodies will not be able to regulate our homeostatic equilibrium soundly. This is where the pH scale is now introduced. Based on the pH of our foods we can determine just how much oxygen our bodies are receiving, due to much higher oxygen yields being present in natural alkaline foods and their non-acidic or hostile nature. If your cells do not receive adequate oxygen they begin to suffer gradually from a growing hypoxic environment that is depriving them of what is needed to survive and manage nutrient retention. In tandem with the constant flow of acids and their byproducts the end result is injurious to both the cells and our tissue, causing inflammation, colonization of dangerous anaerobic (oxygen deprived) bacteria, faulty immune defenses and erosion of the vital processes and organs found in our bodies that keep us healthy by managing our energy, minerals, vitamins, and systemic cleanliness. 

If not taken seriously, the resulting cascade will give birth to acidosis dependent on which part of your body has become the most affected by your poor dieting or inability to have cleansed the toxins from your system. The underlying cause? Meat, dairy, heavy starches, sulfur and sulfites, excessive protein, yeast, artificial vitamins, metals, radioactive isotopes, pesticides, acidic foods, preservatives, crysteine, synthetic oxidized minerals made in laboratories, baked beans, aniline, legumes, vaccines, pharmaceutical drugs, artificial fruits and vegetables, alcohol, parasites, and almost anything you find in your traditional shopping center. These are just some to blame for homeostatic disruption of the intracellular (pHi) or extracellular (pHe) pH, which can end in severe consequences if not treated and will in general eventually lead to death. Although you should never expect your doctor to tell you that you‚Äôre experiencing acidosis, he or she will inform you that you are dying of cancer, tuberculosis, kidney failure, and the many other manifestations of acidosis/homeostatic disruption. Without effectively cleaning any byproducts from your body you will eventually suffer from disease no matter how naturally alkaline your dietary consumption is, which is answered by herbal remedy.

My husband and I used to be plant based before we had kids and I had all the time in the world to cook - I used to make complex dishes that were heavily spiced.  

We fell off the wagon and now we are trying to get ourselves and our young family back to more plant based options.  We are by no means aiming at perfection.   The problem is the same problem faced by all families - young kids who can be a bit picky, and no time!! We can‚Äôt start cooking until 6 and the kids need to eat ASAP, by 6.30 at the latest, otherwise they snack the whole house down and they‚Äôre too tired for dinner.  We hold them off with TV and a plate of raw veggies to snack on, but dinner needs to be on the table pretty fast, and we eat as a family - no seperate meals. 

We‚Äôre also tired and brain-dead.

Headaches, spinning vision, vomiting etc. I decided to avoid problematic products and go for plant based diet to make it easier for me to figure out what I am supposed to eat and what not.

So far I tried some organic milks. Oat milk, Soy milk and Almond milk. While at first I thought soy milk tastes like literal paper water, now I suprisingly find it super tasty. I will definitely never come back to animal milk even if my allergy goes away one day. Cow's milk is simply not tasty compared to these.

Cheese and Ham and meat substitutes. It was pretty weird, not gonna lie. Cheese and ham tasted similarly to what I used to eat before but still a little different what gave me a feeling of eating something weird and unknown to me. I tried it for a bit but couldn't really stick to it because it felt like eating still the same but the tastes got swaped to something else. Now i know I strongly prefer to change my diet instead of looking for substitutes so much. Yet plant based sausages are pretty neat. I am not able to eat a lot of this - maybe one or two - but it still tastes very good.

Tofu - Maybe I just didn't found the right recipe or way of preparing it, but I am not a fan of tofu sadly. I really wanted to get on boar with all these tofu recipes but the way it works always confuses me. I keep forgetting that it's not enough to add seasonings to it, I have to drain it and marinate to give it a taste. Also, the texture is pretty weird. Maybe I will give tofu a second chance in future but for now it's a no no.

Lollipops - I know lollipops aren't plant based food, it's just sugar and flavouring but as allergic peron I had hard time looking for anything sweet - except of fruits - I could eat and I always like to snack something sweet time to time. For the most of the time it wasn't a problem but I do have crawings time to time. Dark chocolate literaly betrayed me because it has milk after all what triggered a pretty bad allergic reaction. So, lollipops are my new fav snacks because I can eat them xD

Dehydrated fruits, pistachio, nuts - Not a fan.

New plants - For the most part of my life I didn't had much liking to plant based food in general. Salads vere very meh to me and all I really knew were potatoes, cucumbers, carrots, onions and barely anything more than these. Right now I am in love with zucchini, sweet potatoes, red onions, peppers etc.

But this family member is extremely resistant to any efforts towards including healthier food choices (which as you know includes almost the entire gamut of edible plants). What's more, she drinks far more sugary sodas like Coke and energy drinks like Monster, which can't be doing her microbiome any favours. She's becoming, quite frankly, more overweight and prone to health issues and joint pains that for a young 20-something should be considered unconscionable. She claims to have anxiety and depression and undiagnosed ADHD. I actually do have *diagnosed* ADHD myself so I understand the challenges around healthy eating it can bring. But whereas I'm trying to take steps to mitigate that in my own choices, she seems to be somewhat resigned to the status quo. There's a lot of ""I'd love to [blank], but my ADHD and anxiety prevent me from [blank]"" in her vocabulary, which is surely a narrative that just feeds the beast even further. 

In all fairness, she has expressed a desire to cut calories and gradually reduce the sugary drinks until they're a weekend 'treat' only. But if we're being totally honest, many of us here came upon WFPB because cutting nutrient quantity was unsustainable, and I'd like her to recognise the importance of nutrient *quality* as it pertains to her dietary choices. 

She's seen a psychologist before about eating disorder, and even saw a hypnotist too (through NHS referral, not just some random quack). All to no avail. She reports vomiting and/or wretching when trying many types of foods, and even subtle textures or colours in foods she already eats can set her off. ""Fussy eater"" doesn't begin to cover it, it's bordering on pathological. The experts are not helping, clearly. She has a better vocabulary to talk about her eating issues, sure, but she still has a visceral reaction to many foods which, if eaten and kept down in gpld spirits, could improve her health outcomes tremendously. 

The result is that I honestly can't tell what falls within her locus of control, and what lies beyond her control. I just know that I don't wanna fast forward another five years and see her in a worse state than she's in now. I'd love to see her feel happy, strong, and healthy. But I'm running out of ways to be supportive, because when the topic of trying new foods comes up, she becomes immediately defensive and dismisses the idea as if it's simply impossible.

My CRP has always tested low but I've developed a number of inflammatory health conditions. Other inflammatory blood markers like rheumatoid factor were in a healthy range, though in the high end of healthy (I'm old though). I've been surprised with the various diagnosis and to learn that they're inflammatory conditions. I'd always thought that these blood tests would show underlying inflammatory conditions, nope. I was wfpb before, long before these diagnosis came to light. Currently these conditions have a large, negative impact on my quality of life. 

Last night I could hear all the deliveroo scooters zooming around delivering their takeaways. It was in that moment, while eating my dinner, a mega bowl of wild rice, broccoli, kale, yam and a whole bunch of other goodies that I realised that I'd probably be dead if I was eating a takeaway or SAD every night for the past several years. That it's more than likely my wfpb diet has kept these conditions from being far-far worse. 

Every time I've engaged with a Dr about this, they don't mention diet or lifestyle at all. I do, I ask if there's anything I should/shouldn't be doing day-to-day. And, every time they tell me to *eat more fruit and veg* (along with a few other common sense things)!

I'm proud of myself for taking the necessary steps to be a healthier person, even if I'm not in good health. I'm proud that I'm still trying to take care of myself and not just give up. And, I'm damn certain I'd be dead right now if I'd not taken these steps years ago.

For context, I have been on a whole food plant-based diet for about a year and do my best to incorporate protein in my diet (eating beans, quinoa, nutritional yeast, etc. when I can) but I don‚Äôt focus much on counting the exact amount &amp; I don‚Äôt take any supplements, protein shakes, protein bars, etc. Meanwhile, my roomate eats animal products and is very focused on protein intake.

As someone on a plant-based diet, it‚Äôs so common to get told ‚ÄúI could never do a plant diet I need protein‚Äù. I know most people are still misinformed about the diet but I didn‚Äôt think I would actually have better protein than my yoked out roomate/her bf. I told my roomate I know she has to eat more protein than I do, and her theory is that she works out more so she‚Äôs probably using it up more. Nothing online supports that (of course I did not tell her that bc I know she was upset about the resulrs) and the only thing I saw mentioned was that higher body fat may lower protein percentage (not sure if I trust that either, it was only mentioned on one site, but it would fit our scenario). 

We‚Äôve tested it against other body composition scales and the original results were accurate, I‚Äôm curious if anyone else has had better protein percantages on a plant based diet and if so, if there may be something about plant protein being absorbed better, or maybe plant-based diets get more precursor nutrients that support protein levels, things like that that may contribute to having such a great protein percentage?",PlantBasedDiet,High protein percentage,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/vqjn8a/high_protein_percentage/,True

For those new to my story, I'll give a brief history why I made the switch, my last decade+ journey into the WFPB life, and where I'm at this year. All of this is anecdotal, meaning my experiences may not be the same as yours, and you should absolutely discuss any major dietary and health changes with a Doctor you trust.  

So 12 years ago I was given 2-6 months to live. I had 98%+ blockage in my four (4) major arteries feeding my heart, and it was nothing short of a miracle I didn't have a heart attack. Unfortunately, I had several factors working against me. First, my arteries are genetically smaller than the average persons (@50-60%), so stints or bypasses are exceptionally risky. I have terrible genetics. On a scale of 1-10 of potential genetic risk, I am at a 10. My father and mother have both had multiple strokes and heart attacks, and I have the genetic immune disorder of psioriatic disease. Good times.  
To live, I changed everything about my life. Browse my post history for details, but at the forefront of these changes was the shift to a whole food plant based lifestyle. This, with other changes, allowed me to beat the odds and turn a 2-6 month diagnosis into a decade of living.   
So I didn't die, hell yeah.  
But the body is impacted by both nature and nurture. We are not only ruled by what we put into our bodies, but by our genetic history. So where my genetic risk for cardiovascular disease is a 10 out of 10, before my lifestyle change I was eating a 9 out of 10 risk. Factored against each other, genetics (10)* food (9) gave me a 90/100 chance of dying well before my time (I made this rating system up, but my surgeon tells me it's pretty accurate). Changing to WFPB (1), reduced that risk to a 10. But a 10, on top of 40 years of abuse, is still a bad scenario.   
So this year I started feeling bad. After slipping a bit over the holidays I just didn't feel 100%. Something was wrong inside me, so in April I went in for a cardiac catherization to see what was up. It was worse than I could have imagined. The surgeon gave me a 1-2% chance to live through the week, and emergency bypass surgery was required. My surgeon, who has performed thousands of these operations (!) placed the difficulty of mine in the top 5 she has ever performed.   

And somehow I survived. *side note - do not allow yourself to go through this, it was not pleasant*  

So here I am 3 months later, thankful to be alive. And I could not be here without a WFPB diet. Recovery has been interesting, as I'm fairly young (early 50s) to have gone through this. *Again, I do not recommend this to anyone.*    
My surgeon and cardiologist agree that if not for the diet I would not have survived as long as I have. They both agree that with the new arteries in place, with my lifestyle, I'll live a full life.   

So there's my perspective on why you should make the change. I believe, as do my Doctors, that this has saved my life. And it could be the key factor in helping you as well.",PlantBasedDiet,WFPB Diet Update + answers to messages,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/vrmy2o/wfpb_diet_update_answers_to_messages/,True

harmonyscher,t2_2b2lxs4w,1657120183,vss8lv,0,/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/vss8lv/tummy_sensitivities/,1,"Hey guys,

So, context: 

A year ago, I had my gallbladder taken out, and right before and right after that surgery, eating anything hurt my stomach a lot to the point I wasn't eating at all. I was also told right before and right after to stay away from any fatty foods until my body adjusted to the surgery. After my surgery, I decided to start from scratch with food because I couldn't eat. I started to eat vegan without putting a name to it, because it was the least fat, and least..""ingredients"" in a single food if that makes sense? (Though it was a LOT of work to cook). 

Eating vegan was the only way I was able to stomach anything without pain. I was vegan for a year, until I moved. 

First time moving out on my own, and getting CPTSD flare ups, I had very little energy to cook like I did. So I started to eat more convenient foods, more and more. And more and more it wasn't vegan, until I didn't care much anymore. I don't remember an adjustment period to more fat and processed foods or meat, that I can recall. By then, my surgery was healed. 

It's been a little less than a year, and I've been eating more and more vegan stuff again. But this time, I've noticed now if I eat dairy, or something too fatty (like fastfood), or even too much rice, I get bloated and my stomach hurts and I get constipated especially if I don't take my meds.

I did get smart this time, and got easy convienient vegan foods for when I can't cook. Gardin stuff, Banza pasta, vegan meat crumbles to put in burritos. Oyster mushroom sandwiches are pretty easy.

Anyway. I was wondering if anyone else has this sensitivity experience where when you do more plant based stuff, you can't stomach anything else without bloating or pain?",PlantBasedDiet,Tummy sensitivities,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/vss8lv/tummy_sensitivities/,True

Changed to a WFPB diet.  
Stopped smoking.  
Started intense cardio.  
Did not die (obviously).   

Over the last decade I've had a great time. Heart blood volume increased, spent time with my wife and kids, etc. My cardiologist attributed this 'miracle' to the lifestyle changes, including the diet. She has made it clear that a cardiac bypass would be extremely dangerous due to the damage and size of my arteries. That under no circumstances would a bypass or stints be a viable, safe option.   

Well, we tested that this year. See, I slipped, and my genetics *really* want me dead. Psioriatic disease ravages my body, and although I had reversed the damage to a limited extent, make no mistake that damage had been done. In the pandemic I got lazy, working from home, sitting 10-12 hours a day, eating processed foods. And early this year I started feeling bad.   

So in April I went in for a Cardiac catheterization to see what was going on, and it was determined that my only chance of living was a triple bypass. The 3 major arteries to my heart were 100% blocked, and I was only alive due to extraordinary circumstances (an expansive secondary arterial network).   

So again, by a *miracle* I lived. My surgeon, who has performed 1000's of bypasses, says mine was easily in the top 5 most difficult. She didn't think it was possible to repair the damage. I am a very lucky person.   

Afterwards, starting the long road to recovery, my Surgeon and Cardiologist agreed the only thing that saved my life was the WFPB lifestyle. they agree, thankfully, that if I maintain this I will have a very good chance at a reasonable lifespan.   

But as my Surgeon put it, lifestyle is only half of it. Genetics rules us. Think of each as a 1-10 scale that factor against each other. So for decades I had terrible genes (10) and a terrible lifestyle (9). So a 90/100 destiny towards dying from some horrible chronic disease.  

Changing to a WFPB lifestyle (1) didn't change my genes (10)... so that 90/100 was slowed, year after year. But my jeans still had impact.  

Now I've been reset, and I'll offset that genetic lottery with the diet I owe my life to.   

So yeah, subjectively, from one persons experience, this diet can save your life. I've *lived* it. But it's not going to necessarily be everything you need. You need to change every aspect of your life. And if you're ancient (40's+ /lol), build a relationship with your Doctors. learn how to communicate effectively with them.   

So that's it. A big post all about my experiences. The path isn't easy, and there's no guarantees.  But it can work. And I'll say, you **do not want your chest cracked open, that sucks balls**. So try to avoid that if you can.",PlantBasedDiet,"WFPB Diet: Save my life, but not a magic bullet",https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/vty9yg/wfpb_diet_save_my_life_but_not_a_magic_bullet/,True

So um to be honest I am a bit scared to post on this sub as I am not completly plant based when it comes to my diet. I tried looking for some tasty plant based recipes on vegan group before but people got very hostile towards me when I mentioned that I changed my diet recently due to my health condittion (Allergy) . That means I can no lomger eat cow's milk, cheese, yogurts, eggs and most meats but I am still eating fish and chicken meat but outside of that, I am doing my best to plan my meals with as much vegetables and fruits as possible.

I really hope it's okay for me to be here and I won't get any more hate for not being 100% at something. I just wish I can connect with people who eats plant based food, answer my questions and concers and perhaps give me some great food ideas that will be tasty and good for health. 

I am on more plant based or plant infused diet for a few days now and I must admit I feel pretty great, but I have some concerns about what I eat, how much can I eat these etc. So, please tell me if this is really fine:

**For breakfast** I usually eat fruits right now. Either it's a baked apple or banana + freshly blended fruit juice. Grapes, blackberries, kivi etc. Can I really eat fruits every day or will ir raise my sugar too much? my other breakfast idea is oat milk + corn flakes but to be fair, I prefer vanilla flavoured oat milk. Is it healthy option or should I treat vanilla oat milk like regular vanilla milk and make sure I won't be drinking too much of it?

**For snack** I either eat light salad with vinegrette sauce or fres cucumber stipes with soy sauce. Is it okay to eat it daily? Won't too much of vinegar from sauce and salt from soy sauce cause some damage to my organism? 

**For dinner** I like to eat things such like rice balls, salads with some amount of chicken or fish (please don't kill me. It's really not like I don't care for animals, I just like these) and a lot of potatoes. Either mashed or baked etc but my biggest concern here is...aren't my dinners too bland? Pasta, rice, potatoes, isn't it not nutrious enough to be a big part of each dinner or I should switch to something else? If yes, do you have any ideas what is easy to cook enough and tastes good? I must admit that for the majority of my life I didn't had much vegetables so I am not used to lot of tastes.

**For supper** it's either whole grain bread with tomato slice/cucumber or radish or oats. Can I have oats daily? I know it might sounds silly but once I heard that if you eat too much oats you can literally get worms.

Once again, I am really sorry if it offends you that I am not 100% plant based but still want to be a part of this community. I had one unpleasant experience and I really don't want to stirr any more trouble. I really want my diet to be at least 90% plant based. Hope you can help!",PlantBasedDiet,"Hi, I am new!

I've been losing weight or trending downward since January 2018.  I decided that I needed to stop losing weight when I was twenty pounds heavier than I am now.  I original only wanted to get my weight to the middle of the healthy weight range according to BMI.

I'm now at the bottom of that range.  I haven't had a new low this month.  Last month, I hit a new low on my scale at 98.  This month, most of the time, my weight has been between 99 and 101 on my scale (My scale weighs the same as the one at the doctor's office which others claim to be high.).  I'm afraid that my weight will continue to drop if I don't keep adding occasionally junk food meal.  Yesterday, I ate meat and cheese with one of my meals.  I find it hard to stay plant-based when I have this problem with keeping my weight up.

According to my doctor, I'm very healthy and there is no medical reason for my weight loss.  I'm just not eating enough.  I don't digest nuts.  I dislike avocado and olives.  I'm slowly adding more beans to my diet.  I know that I need to eat more starches to get sufficient calories.

I‚Äôll start with the authentic and brief premise of the diet. You are reverting back to the human body‚Äôs natural roots that lie in the heart of the African bio mineral balance which represents what human beings ate before they left Africa and colonized other parts of the planet. Since we know that all human life began in Africa we know that the Africans, or our early ancestors, did not have cows, sheep, corn, white rice, or any of the foods that were grown artificially through hybridization and other methods. What they ate were the crops that the land naturally produced. There was no need for meat as all early humans were strictly alkaline eating vegans by default. It is not a diet that is creating an artificial uniformity to cure or aid the body, but rather a divorce from the uniformity of Western and European societies that have deceived the human population into adopting their industries, replacing their natural way of life.

**HISTORY &amp; ORIGIN**

Read this with an open mind. It was pioneered and reintroduced to us by Alfredo Bowman, otherwise known as Dr. Sebi, the former steam engineer who cured all disease through the revolution of the alkaline diet and herbal treatment including his own diabetes and asthma. He won a supreme court trial against him after he claimed he could cure AIDS by bringing numerous patients of his to court (77 to be exact). Many have been to his village in Honduras and have been cured (Some real world examples cited here below) although unfortunately he was wrongly imprisoned and passed away due to lack of food, clean water, and negligent care within the penitentiary.

**CLEARING MISCONCEPTIONS**

**MYTH:** The alkaline diet and its supposed benefits are falsified due to its inability to change the body‚Äôs pH (Besides urine) based on research. 

**TRUTH:** While it makes absolute sense to assume that the agenda would be to change the body‚Äôs pH, what the diet actually is doing is removing the mucus and waste from the body that is the result of artificial, acidic foods and their byproducts circulating the body engaging the human‚Äôs innate defense mechanism. While human beings produce mucus to defend itself from any kind of intrusion or threat the human body is not designed to constantly fight against threats of this sort nor is it meant to because it will begin to treat the body itself as the threat since there are nothing but acidic byproducts in the body perpetuating this cycle. This, in turn, results in varying diseases that are consistent with whichever part of the body contains the mucus. When there is mucus in the bronchial tubes it‚Äôs bronchitis, when it is in the lungs it is pneumonia, when it is in the sinuses it is sinusitis and so on and so forth. While the mucus is meant to break down various levels of infection it is now attacking and slowly breaking down the organs in the human body from the inside out.

Although there are artificial foods that are alkaline it is not just the pH that is a concern, but also the artificial byproducts of the foods themselves. For example, and also in reference to the misconception, the blood may be considered alkaline with a resting pH of around 7.3-7.4 that is unchanged on the surface, but inside the blood may be an excess of uric acid, amino acids and other foundational acids that do not deliberately change the given pH of whatever they are a part of. This is why the body‚Äôs pH on the surface is relatively unchanged no matter what you eat, but needs naturally alkalizing foods in order to heal it. Once the body returns to its natural state and all of the toxins as well as mucus are removed from the organs in the body your body is cured and may then return to its natural lifestyle. This is an explanation of why those undergoing treatment by Sebi or his family are required to do a colon cleanse before completely detoxifying their body while also taking in the herbs that provide the body with natural iron and minerals to restore the intracellular health of whomever is being treated for their disease.

**MYTH:** The alkaline diet does not cure or aid disease and makes no difference according to ‚Äúvalid‚Äù research. 

**TRUTH:** For those In disbelief, one great example of how removing acidic foods from your diet can cure or save you trouble from a plethora of diseases is in the documented cases of **gout**. Once uric acid in the blood becomes extreme enough you run the risk of developing many different diseases or life threatening conditions such as stroke, heart attack, heart failure, and more while if you were to only digest alkaline foods the pH of your urine would begin to rise and eventually you‚Äôd stabilize the level of uric acid in the blood even in some very extreme conditions thus eventually curing and preventing further damage.

Here's the link: [https://www.marksdailyapple.com/vegan-island/](https://www.marksdailyapple.com/vegan-island/) 

I thought this was a WFPB diet he promotes? I am really bamboozled. Anyone want to chime in? 

Here's the text pertaining to it: 

""I am an omnivore and always have been. Carrie, my wife, was a vegetarian for fifteen years until I convinced her about five years ago to starting adding fish to her diet to get more protein. She still considers herself, in the words of the Outback Steakhouse guy, a ‚Äúsemi-veg.‚Äù My wife‚Äôs parents have been strict vegans for nearly thirty years and are ardent followers of Dr. McDougall. McDougall‚Äôs own story involves having had a severe stroke at age 19 from which, at 59, he still limps. He became an MD and eventually realized that diet was an important part of the health equation. He‚Äôs a very likable and charming guy. I had a few superficial discussions with him, even attended a few of his nightly lectures. **His heart is certainly in the right place, but I fear he is leading people down a wholly inappropriate dietary path**. At the risk of oversimplifying, the basis of his program is that almost all starch is good, all fat is bad and meat of any kind is deadly. It is, in his words, a ‚Äústarch-based‚Äù diet, high in grains and legumes.

The attendees were generally divided into two groups: those who were fairly new to the program ‚Äì many of them had some serious weight to lose ‚Äì and those who had been on the McDougall program for several years. Many of the latter group, I gathered, had come to McDougall originally with one or more chronic diseases and on multiple medications. Each evening, after the adventure activity of the day (all of which were pretty sedate), Dr. McDougall would deliver a lecture intended to inform the group of the evils of traditional medicine and big pharma ‚Äì much of which I generally agree with ‚Äì and to **demonize beef, pork, chicken, fish, dairy of all kinds and most forms of soy**. I got the general gist after the first evening. He‚Äôs not a fan of supplements either. But he does imply that when you eat vegetarian, you can have all you want‚Ä¶and therein lay the source of much amusement for me.

The lecture would adjourn and everyone would line up for the buffet line which would, at virtually every meal, include copious amounts of breads and rolls, rice, potatoes, pasta, beans, some anemic-looking steamed vegetables and a romaine-only lettuce salad. No dressings allowed. The only fat I could see was in the guacamole that served as a spread. The desert table had a variety of fruits and at least two choices of so-called ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù cakes. The drinks were generally overly sweetened fruit drinks.

Now I‚Äôm not one to judge. Okay, I am, but I usually keep my mouth shut ‚Äì except herein. I watched at every meal as overweight, unhealthy people piled their plates with at least two pounds of bread, pasta, rice, potatoes, beans, desert cake, and a glass of fruit juice. Sometimes they went back for more. By my calculations these people were consuming 200 to 300 or more grams of (mostly simple) carbohydrates at each of three meals. There was no way these folks were going to lose fat on this trip. **It was, in my view, a type 2 diabetes epidemic in-the-making**.""",PlantBasedDiet,Why does McDougall give his patients refined foods?,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/v9k268/why_does_mcdougall_give_his_patients_refined_foods/,True

I do a lot of weight and endurance training and I'm quite a big woman so I'm aiming to get 100g protein daily (at the lower end of what's recommended for athletes).  I tend to meal prep at the start of the week for 4 days of work and then wing it a bit more at the weekend. Last week, I made a lentil and rice curry, bean and quinoa chili and then porridge with soya milk, berries, nuts and flaxseed for breakfast.  I struggled with the volume of food and couldn't quite finish lunch and dinner at the time. However, when I inputted into cronometer (as if I'd eaten the full portion), I still would only have eaten less than 1500 calories with 65g protein which is too little for someone my size.

So this week, I've been looking for some recipes that have larger amounts of protein but not massive volume, mainly lunch and dinners.  I have found some red lentil pasta that I can use and I'm going to experiment with tofu.  I've tried using tempeh before but never made it palatable.

Since changing to this lifestyle I have noticed significant changes to how I feel and how much energy I have now!

A big concern of mine was getting enough protein because being someone who is predisposed to depression, getting enough amino acids is crucial to building neurotransmitters for mental health.

I have been tracking my protein intake with the goal of getting about 70-100g of protein a day. 

Having been on different diets and being able to build strength and muscle on as low as 50g a day, I figure that‚Äôs a good range for me. 

However, I have been plugging the foods I‚Äôve been eating into Cronometer and have been SHOCKED at how much protein I have been getting eating about 1500-2000 calories a day!

Most of the time without even thinking, I‚Äôm at 80-90g of protein but mostly, I stay above 100. 

Protein IS important but not at the expense of all the vast micronutrients we need for optimum health.

I feel I am successful because I eat lots of BEANS, Legumes, tofu, edamame, high protein vegetables like broccoli and Brussels sprouts, and oats. 

Tonight I‚Äôm making stuffed peppers with lentils and mushrooms and I CANNOT WAIT!!

Until I started making the switch, I was eating some processed foods every day. Not a ton, but there was something processed in most of my meals.

I tried giving up: foods made with flour, oils, refined sugar, and processed ""junk food"" (like potato chips). I ate a lot of raw fruits and vegetables, nuts, and cooked grains. 

I did not give up tofu, tempeh, and meat substitutes that don't contain refined sugar. I kept eating things like peanut butter and sauces provided the ingredients were just whole foods, avoiding refined sugar and preservatives.

I felt incredible for the first 10 days. Then my body started to kind of get tired of it. I craved bread because it's easy to digest and full of those artificially added nutrients. So I gave in and had a little bread, and then some vegan ice cream! 

I'm not trying to be a purist about WF. I just want to get healthier.

- no calorie counting
- breakfasts are commonly oatmeal or smoothie bowl

- I snack on random things if they are available, from olives, chips, chocolate, fruits, etc
- I binge eat like 1-3x/week
- I just pickled a bunch of vegetables and oh my god I'm so excited to eat them in a few days

Other potential factors:
- I get 6-8 hours of sleep most nights
- I can't work out for a month because of surgery 2 weeks ago
- I walk a lot on some days and barely move on others.
- I stopped doing drugs and drinking 8 months ago
- I take a lot of vitamins, decided to stop taking iron because of constipation

While a lot of information and promotion exists for Omega 3s I don‚Äôt see a lot of compelling reasons to increase omega 6 intake to a particular minimum. This is likely because most people get in way too many omega 6s vs omega 3 since omega 6s bioaccumulate more through farmed animal products that use lots of grains for feed. I also assume it is because the ratio of both omegas for optimal health is contested.

Secondly while I do get enough of the essential amino acid methionine within my 1,500 calories a day diet to survive I am not sure if it is enough to thrive athletically. This is cause I always seem to get juuuust enough methionine for living but not much more for additional abuse like I do the other aminos. This makes me feel like I need more methionine rich plant sources other then just my spinach.

The way I see it, hemp seeds are relatively rich in both omega 6 and methionine with an inconsequential reduction of omega 3s. This makes me feel like swapping out the flax and chia for hemp seeds would be a net positive.

I (33f) recently had some blood work done and found out my cholesterol is higher than I‚Äôd like it to be. I‚Äôve been a junk food vegan for a long time, and decided that it was time to take my health more seriously. I started wfpb two weeks ago, and I‚Äôve been enjoying the change. I don‚Äôt even miss the oils and fats. I‚Äôve been monitoring my weight and lost 3 lbs in the past two weeks, which I‚Äôm very excited about as I‚Äôm about 10 lbs  overweight. I‚Äôm very hopeful that my cholesterol is moving down in the right direction.

I‚Äôve noticed this enthusiasm is not really shared by my friends and loved ones. I‚Äôve told two close family members about my experience so far, and the only thing they had to say was ‚Äúok but you need to treat yourself sometime.‚Äù It‚Äôs only been two weeks! I haven‚Äôt expressed any difficulty in eating wfpb or any desire to go back to my old ways, so I don‚Äôt understand why no one seems supportive?

Then one day two weeks ago, I slowly began to feel terrible stomach cramps. I thought it was period cramps, but it was so much worse. I was nauseous and not eliminating. I was afraid to eat. At one point, it was so bad I just laid in the tub sobbing because I couldn‚Äôt manage the pain. I tried Biofreeze, pain meds, a hot shower, and heating pads - nothing seemed to help. It took about three days before the pain began to subside. Admittedly, I took a couple of hits of weed to relax enough to try to go to the restroom, and it seemed to work (I don‚Äôt normally smoke and it wasn‚Äôt enough to even feel high). My insides (whole digestive tract) felt sore for days afterwards. 

Since this happened, I have been too nervous to go back to this way of eating 100%. I went to the doctor and got an X-ray, but it revealed nothing. The doctor doesn‚Äôt seem to be concerned, but the pain was the worst of my life and I‚Äôm just afraid of suffering again. 

Before this diet, I was keto for several years. Before that, it was a standard American diet. I have never eaten a vegetable and bean-forward diet before now, and probably never a high fiber diet.

Sorry if you get this a lot on this sub. But I‚Äôm considering plant based diet and, as a potential newbie, I guess my two main concerns are:

But how you get carbs? How you get protein?

My first thought for carbs is whole wheat bread (wait not sure if thats plant based technically). Maybe potatoes actually, that sounds better. I think potatoes have some protein too actually. 

For protein, maybe there are high protein veggies I can make sure I eat a lot of. And of course beans and lentils (and chickpeas or other legumes maybe too).

Mainly I would do this for my GI health, up my fiber intake and micronutrients. I overall want to be healthier but again my concern are carbs and protein and maybe other nutrients I might lose by going plant based.

- My diet is a majority whole foods.

-- vegetables (leafy greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, carrots, celery, etc)
-- fruits (apples and bananas)
-- calorie dense homemade sauces (cashew based creamy sauces and dressings mostly)
- I avoid (but do not exclude) empty carbs (bread, pasta) and sugar (candy, sweets, pastries, etc).

- hour of yoga 4-5x a week
- a little strength training at the gym about 2-3x a week.

My farts still smell awful and I'm constipated. I only poop like once a week. I eat a lot of food and I don't count calories. I've actually gained like 5lbs since starting to intermittent fast.

I'm so afraid I'm gonna jinx myself by posting here, but I really want some feedback on this.  
So I'm trying to eat beegan. For the past 3 weeks, I've been using up all my animal food products and only buying new vegan food products and meals. Ever since last Saturday, the only animal products I've been consuming are Honeycomb cereal and my remaining butter and non-vegan supplements (Vitamin D and hair, skin, and nail vitamins). I used up my Eggo waffles the day before that, my oysters earlier that week, and my eggs and sardines the week prior. So I'm about 3 weeks with no meat or poultry, a week with no eggs, and over a week with no fish.  
Now, one obvious change I've noticed but never expected: my hair is a lot less greasy! As long as I can remember, my hair has been so greasy, I need to wash it every day. I did try training it in 2020 by washing it less since I had nowhere to go, but it still felt too gross for me to bear, so I gave up.  
Well, 3 days ago, I decided screw it, I'd sleep for a few more minutes and just spend the day with my greasy hair, won't kill me... except, it didn't look half as bad as it usually does! I skipped it again this morning. Same thing. Not date night or job interview nice but not nearly as embarrassing as it should be.

Unfortunately, it's not available locally, so I have to order it online, and that can get expensive. This morning, I was thinking about that (while putting in a new order), and realized that I could probably make something like it myself, especially since I have oat groats, wheat, and other whole grains lying around the house. I went to look up how to do it, and nearly all the recipes seem to have oil, although the puffed kamut I buy doesn't have any oil. 

Has anybody managed to make something like this themselves? I have an air fryer... I also have a silicone bowl that we use to make popcorn.

I have struggled with depression, anxiety, dissociation, and general feelings of fear and paranoia for as long as I can remember. I always had an instinctual sense that what I put into my body has a direct impact on how I feel, so I started experimenting with ‚Äúdiets‚Äù pretty young. In my teens, I first fell into the trap of ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù packaged foods, and then I had an eating disorder. In my twenties, I tried keto several times, paleo, Whole 30, and having other arbitrary food restrictions. In between I had a more or less ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù average diet, with periods of bingeing on processed junk. I‚Äôve never been overweight but I‚Äôve always been skinny-fat. I‚Äôve also always been really low energy, had tons of brain fog, had some skin and constipation symptoms, and generally just felt like I wasn‚Äôt living anywhere near my potential. 

About 6 months ago I decided to try a WFPB diet. I wasn‚Äôt perfect because I eat out a few times per week; I would very occasionally eat fried food, and even when I didn‚Äôt, I know that all restaurants cook with oil. I ate some processed foods like breads, but most of my diet was fruits, veggies, whole grains, beans/lentils, and some nuts. 

When I tell you I have never felt better in my *entire* life ‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt even explain it. It was like a fog that had been present since memory had finally lifted. It was like I was finally myself. 

Then, a month ago, I started eating some fish and dairy and oil. Not every day, but I became lax. Toast with butter and an egg for breakfast some days, salmon for dinner other days. Potato chips for a snack, fries and a veggie burger with cheese when out to eat. Cooking a veggie stir fry with oil. Within a month of eating more lax I felt crazy again. It was like my dopamine receptors totally reverted to a state of desensitization and I felt out of control. I started scrolling social media more, I lacked motivation, I was sad and paranoid and unstable. 

This past week, I have gotten back to a WFPB diet. I‚Äôm not perfect about it and I may not ever be, but WOW does it make a huge difference for my mental health. Within a few days I felt that sense of clarity and incredible energy I lost during my month of eating more animal products and oils. I‚Äôm getting more done, I feel brighter and happier, and best of all, I feel like myself. 

I credit a lot of this change in me to the fact that fat consumption has more to do with hypoglycemia that sugar consumption does. I don‚Äôt have any studies to quote right now but they‚Äôre out there - basically the point is that fat fills the cells and prevents glucose from entering them, leading to a high level of glucose in the blood stream, which leads to blood sugar imbalances. Keto takes glucose out of the equation entirely, but doesn‚Äôt solve the problem. A low fat, high glucose diet does solve the problem, by allowing glucose to enter cells unencumbered by fat. Stabilized blood sugar means stabilized mood. 

Overall, I think there is a threshold for eating animal products for me. A bit of fish every couple of months may be okay, but animal products most days is not okay. I‚Äôm honestly just extremely happy that I‚Äôve finally, after all these years, figured out a diet that makes me feel how I have always known I could feel. The research about the physical health benefits is just the cherry on top :)

My final words are that I want anyone reading this who is on the fence about a plant based diet and is struggling with poor mental health - PLEASE try it. I have tried medication, therapy, meditation, and physical activity, and they are all special and important parts of mental health, but I can tell you that NOTHING has changed my life the way that a WFPB diet has.

I have an issue I would love to have advice for.  
I find it hard to get in enough calories with the healthy foods that makes my body feel/function the best. This is low fat whole plant based foods like whole grain, legumes, fruit, vegetable, nuts and seeds. I have low appetite and this healthy food is really filling.  
As a result I have added calorie dense, oily, salty and sugary foods/drinks on top of this to get in enough calories. But I fear this is holding my energy levels back in the long run.  


I am having some ideas:  
1. Accept it! Eat healthy and let the weight reduce until it stablizes? Maybe it will around 72 kg (past experience). Currently happy with a more ""muscular"" 88kg, 185cm 29y male.  
2. Replace carbohydrate sources with refined variants to lower fiber content.  
3. Cut back fruit and vegetables servings from 4-8 down to 2-4, making room for more calorie dense whole grains/legumes.  
4. Stuff myself beyond appetite and hope body adapts over time to increased food volume/intake.

Even after the 3 months every Sunday where everyone was passive aggressive because I ate pasta they all were eating, except I didn‚Äôt reach for meat balls. Because that‚Äôs horribly rude!!!

But I thought it would end. I never brought it up. But it never did. After my father passed away still wanted to keep fighting and battling because she believed it would ‚Äúcure‚Äù my condition.

And the god dam excuses she kept using was outrageous.

Huge slab of fish out in my food when no one else had it: ‚Äúfish isn‚Äôt meat‚Äù

But i draw the line here: she kept making me ‚Äúplant based‚Äù soups. I couldn‚Äôt figure out why on earth she kept asking how I felt.

I kept vomiting which was weird. She kept yelling at me over it sobbing. Guess I‚Äôm suppose to ignore the pain ?

And then after the 5th time I demanded to know what it has

‚ÄúNo no it‚Äôs nothing! All plants ! It has bacon for flavoring but it‚Äôs not in the food, it‚Äôs flavoring it!‚Äù

This is why I throw out all your food .


You become passive aggressive al the time over this. You don‚Äôt watch anyone else not eat certain items in the table, just me.

And you began sobbing because I told you I didn‚Äôt want any more of her food.

There is always a excuse for you to poison me isn‚Äôt there? But it doesn‚Äôt matter how many times I vomit! You deep down know why I‚Äôm disabled and will spend even more than the 10 years that have passed arguing about this like you are a victim. Crying to other people about how I‚Äôm mean and bad.

For gods sake. I was with you last night at another family members house celebrating. And there was multiple types of the same food. And you asked me which one I wanted. I told you the one without meat.

You pretended not to hear me, asked again.

    NRAL = 0.91P - 0.57K + 21 
where P is grams of protein and K is milligrams of potassium divided by 39.1 (potassium in millimoles)



For example: according to cronometer, one day I ate 97.6g of protein and at least 10860.5mg of potassium (84.6% confidence rating).  

NRAL = 0.91\*97.6 - 0.57*(10860.5/39.1) + 21 = -48.5

If you adjust the potassium level upwards by a factor of (100/84.6), NRAL drops to -77.3

NRAL is dimensionless with higher values indicating more acid load.  The values observed in the paper were between 12 and 136.  My values are much lower than the ones cited in the paper, but I also consumed way more potassium than any of the subjects.

*Processing img b1x4ggf4r3a81...*

 

Ben pulled up to his friend's house, the music was thumping people were hanging out and chit-chatting. He soon made his way inside to be greeted by the smell of delicious food. Ben was hungry. His head spun around the room to find the table; it was pushed up against the way in the corner with a full spread. Drinks, dip, chips, and lots of grub. He hurriedly gave everyone a shout-out then made a b-line to the table. He piled his plate high and pulled up a chair at the bar.¬†

¬†""This food is banging,"" he mumbled with a mouth full of potato salad. His friend [Soul](https://twitter.com/Soultherapy_09) had pulled up a chair beside him with a plate like his. The two made small talk in between the pleasurable sounds of agreement on how good everything tasted.¬†

‚ÄúThis is some good Vegan food,‚Äù Soul smiled winking at Ben.¬†

""Vegan Food,"" Ben was so shocked he dropped his fork on the ground.

üì∑

""Yeh, vegan,"" she repeated.

""Didn't you see the note on the table beside the dishes,"" she shrugged

¬†""No, I didn't see any note!""¬†He barked.

""I was so hungry I had no idea that there was vegan food here.""

Ben looked disgusted as if vegan was an alternative species as if he had accidentally eaten fish food or something. His only reference point for vegans was the annoying people on his timeline, radicals throwing paint on furs, or his one friend that guilts him out of eating chicken wings every time they hang out. The shock and hidden pleasure he felt from that meal haunted him the whole ride home.¬†

*""I should have known something was up,""*¬†he thought as you gripped the steering wheel. The way his friend kept snickering and asking him how he liked the meal should have told him something was up.¬†

*I can't shake the feeling, or the taste of the egg-free, butter-free cookies.* *Not to mention the taco dip I scarfed down. I couldn't tell it wasn't ground beef.* *On the low, I feel violated for not being told sooner but at the same time I want more.*

The next few weeks were torture, he wanted to talk to someone but made so many vegan salad eating jokes he didn't know who to trust. Every night he would sneak off to binge-watch YouTube and Tik-Tok cooking videos. He eventually found a Vegan YouTube [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=vegan%20youtube) and bookmarked about ten recipes that he wanted to try at home.

¬†Late one night, Ben sat down to check his crypto portfolio; everything was good for the most part so, he pulled up a few vegan documentaries. He watched them all and soon found himself pondering the connection between veganism and the crypto he loved so much. Funny enough it was his annoying vegan friend who introduced him to Bitcoin a few years ago. Crypto changed his life, she tried to change his diet but that's where he drew the line.¬†

¬†Recently, he got put on to[ NFT's](https://opensea.io/collection/theyummyburger) they opened a whole new world. The NFT world reminded him of his love for art. and pulled him into social spaces to meet people he may have otherwise never met.¬†¬†The more he thought, the clearer the picture became. Both veganism and crypto are disrupters, changing the old paradigm and introducing a new way of doing things. Both have pioneered and those who have taken an opposing side fighting to uphold the system as it was. Both get mainstream attention which in turn attracts the authentic and charlatans alike. Both are like the wild-wild west uncharted territory with major prospects of gold-digging. Both have junk clouding the judgment of newcomers who are unsure where to start and how to maintain in this new space. Finally, both have room to grow, education opportunities, and space to integrate the old and the new. Ben started to understand that to value one doesn't mean you have to devalue the other.¬†

At that moment, he picked up the phone to give that crypto vegan chick a call. She knew he would call and answered on the first ring.¬†

I'm 22 Y.O., a college student, BMI around 27 (middle of the overweight range). I've been overweight as long as I can remember. I've tried losing weight before (tracking calories), but have struggled with consistency (ADHD, I'd just forget) as well as cravings and appitite aside from when I was on a study medication to control them. I'm actually at a lower weight than my heaviest though, by about 30lbs. I've been hovering around my current weight for at least 3 years, with some moderate fluctuations.

Recently, I had blood work for something unrelated, and got some concerning results about some liver functioning, cholesterol, and also very low vitamin D levels (which have always been fine in the past, even when I was strictly vegan). My doctor was tentatively concerned,  and prescribed a high dose Vit D supplement, and follow up blood work in a few months. They said that the liver stuff *could* be from recently having COVID.  But given my low D (even with a diet that should be rich in it, and having been outside more the past 6 months than typical for me), I'm worried it could be the start of something serious like NAFL. 

The main treatments for NAFL seem to be lifestyle things that are a good idea anyway, like better diet and exercise, so I figure that I will focus on those as an outlet for my medical anxiety until my next bloodwork.

I've been vegan, ""mostly plant based"", pescatarian, and vegetarian in the past. I definitely don't want to eat meat at this stage, and ideally would like to be entirely plant based. I don't drive, and most of the grocery shopping is done by a roommate who does. I'd like to find healthy recipes that are simple in terms of components and quick to cook, and lowish in sodium, without added sugars or many simple carbs. Something akin to the Mediterranean diet, without the animal protein. Any suggestions?
